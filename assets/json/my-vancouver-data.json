As 'play-sculptures' that combine modernist sculpture, mid-century playground designs, and monochrome patterns, these sensuous organic forms will invite a more physical engagement than is normally allowed with public art, providing occasions for children, families, and staff to play. The vision of the artists is to engage audiences of all ages and abilities with the sculptures' tactile qualities and lift their spirits with their humour and playfulness, creating a transition zone between the everyday and the extraordinary.Playtime is originally inspired by the 'play-sculptures' of English sculptor John Bridgeman (1916-2004) and Danish architect and sculptor Egon Moller-Nielsen (1915-1959), the work of Henry Moore, and two female artists, Barbara Hepworth (1903-1975) and Bridget Riley (1931-present), all of whom were producing works around the same time.",

Finger-post signs can point to mundane and everyday places (train stations, toilets, bus stops) or at natural wonders, buildings and locations of historical importance and places of deep civic pride. Still other finger post signs point to places left behind or places dreamt about: signs pointing, with distances, to far away cities, inspiring longing for elsewhere or awe at the distances between us. \r\n\r\nThis finger-post sign however provides none of these directions; the arrows provide no information and point seemingly randomly in every which way. It is at once both comic and melancholy, referring to possible histories, journeys, and most of all to the constant change and flux of the neighbourhood around it. The sign leaves it up to the viewer to determine the meaning of the arrows, and what they are pointing at. The artwork responds to the neighbourhood&rsquo;s relative newness and lack of specific geographical histories. Ultimately, it invites passers-by to create their own direction and attach the narrative they see fit.",

Tsang covers the walls of Offsite with text composed of adverse rhetoric ofVancouver newspaper editorial columns from the 1980s but also contrasts it withvoices of inclusion to compose floral patterns that unravel to form the body of adragon.",

At Offsite, they present Fitness For All, a fivepiece set of exercise equipment evoking campaigns throughout the Peoples Republic of China aimed atmotivating society to pay more attention to health. In the early 2000s the government began to install exercise equipment in public parks throughout the country, and since then the machines have worked their way into the daily regimen of millions of people.While outdoor public exercise equipment is common in China, relocated to Vancouver’s urban core, the work has adopts a new social and cultural context. One that allows the artists to examine whether collectivism is really a social need or just a management tool. In Canada, individualism is a fundamental value yet a newunderstanding of the need for the collective has emerged. Conversely, in China, where collectivism has been a core value throughout most of history, the last decade has indicated an increase in individual pursuits. Through their interactive public performances and happenings, PSFO tests where the desire of collective organizationarises naturally from human nature or is an expression of ideology.Fitness For All encourages audience participation. The work is both purely visual (as contemporary sculpture) as well as purpose built and customized to provide a public service. For PSFO, the fitness equipment is secondary to providing space and opportunity for collective gathering with friends, visitors and passersby, thereby advocating for a model of social organization that benefits the community as a whole.\" - Courtesy of the Vancouver Art Gallery",

The abstracted video feed, from a webcam incorporated into a public control panel at street level, reflects the street activity, animating the patio area.The animated display has a second function: triggered by a button on the control panel, the video feed becomes the starting-point for a computer animation of abstract figures which move, evolve and travel across the display. Many will recognize this particular procedurally-generated animation as the computer program known as Game Of Life, which unfolds frame-by-frame through a simple set of rules that determines whether each pixel lights up, stays lit, turns off, or stays off based on the number of its neighbours which are lit. The animation is intriguing because it creates patterns that appear intentional, and seem to relate to human activity.",

Chinese Cultural Center (CCC) has been providing facilities and initiatives for language classes, exhibitions, and cultural performances etc since the 1920s. Not limited to only Chinese-speaking patrons, CCC is a safe space where those who love Chinese culture can share their interests and where young people or native-born Chinese can explore their roots. It is important to emphasize that Chinatown is not only for Chinese or tourists but a space that welcomes everyone to celebrate the beauty of diversity.When one generation passes their secret recipes or tell their life stories to the next generation, it is like passing down little pieces of cultural heritage. I hope the mural introduces a slice of Chinatown’s multicultural and intergenerational community in a fun and optimistic way.",

The saying “eight immortals crossing the sea, each with their prowess” has become an allegory to describe how everyone has a unique way to complete the task. The eight immortals, in the context of migration, can be seen as representations and celebrations of diversity in all the individuals that make up the history of Vancouver’s Chinatown: those who have overcome difficulties, and those who have made contributions tothis community, each in their own way.We hope the mural, through its exploration of Chinese mythology in a local context, can act as a catalyst to re-imagine Vancouver’sChinatown, its history, and its people as the work re-interprets a traditional story in celebration of the real stories of the community members who shaped this neighbourhood. We also hope the depiction of a classic legend can spark conversations between generations, and provide an opportunity to bridge cultures.《⼋八仙過海海》是⼀一個廣為⼈人知的中國神話，講述了了⼋八位神仙各⾃自施展法⼒力力橫渡東海海的故事。由此故事發展出的諺語—「⼋八仙過海海，各顯神通」寓意每個⼈人都有其獨特的⽅方法去戰勝困難。重新詮釋的「⼋八仙」也象徵了了所有通過不不同⽅方式跨海海來來到這⽚片⼟土地，戰勝困難，為唐⼈人街社區做出貢獻的⼈人們。⼋八卦藝術家⼩小組嘗試⽤用壁畫形式呈現神話故事《⼋八仙過海海》，並傳遞其背後蘊藏的象徵意義。壁畫本身在溫哥華唐⼈人街獨特社區⽂文化的基礎上為唐⼈人街提供了了新的想像空間，為觀看者理理解唐⼈人街社區的歷歷史和社區成員提供了了新的內容。通過重新詮釋的《⼋八仙過海海》故事來來讚揚所有參參與建設唐⼈人街社區的個體和其⼈人⽣生經歷歷；同時可以為⻑⾧長者和⻘青少年年，華裔和⾮非華裔加拿⼤大⼈人之間的交流搭建橋樑。",

The public artworks at this site continue Falk’s devotion to keen observations of everyday objects, as well as her use of repetition, both of which have been central to her practice for over six decades.For 10 Baseball Caps, the artist produced three different papier mâché caps with slight variations which were then cast in bronze in multiples of three or four and installed in an alternating pattern in primary colours. The caps hang in a group facing downward on the column at the entrance of the building as they might inside the entrance of one’s home, bridging Falk’s explorations of domestic content with the public realm. 10 Baseball Caps bear the traces of human presence while reflecting Falk’s career-long interest in utilizing elements of clothing to explore gender, ritual and status.",

It has particular historical significance as a former location of Vancouver City Hall (1889-1929) where mayors and councillors used the legal power of the City to enact and expand laws that negatively impacted Chinese residents.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Saltwater City Vancouver/鹹水埠温哥华&rdquo; was developed by Wong as part of his year-long residency &ldquo;身在唐人街/Occupying Chinatown&rdquo; at Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden (2018&ndash;2019) commissioned by the City of Vancouver Public Art Program.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Paul&rsquo;s &lsquo;Saltwater City Vancouver&rsquo; neon inspires conversations about the importance of understanding and appreciating both the tangible and intangible heritage assets when we celebrate the significance of Chinatown, its history, people and language in relation to the City,&rdquo; said Vincent Kwan, Executive Director, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden.\r\n\r\nThe launch of Wong&rsquo;s residency in April 2018 coincided with the City of Vancouver&rsquo;s formal apology for historical discrimination against Chinese residents in Vancouver. During the residency the artist has translated and examined over 700 letters and artifacts from his late mother Suk-Fong Wong, using them as a source of inspiration to realize workshops, performances, and artworks in photography, video, and sculpture including this neon work. \r\n\r\nThe letters and artworks were presented as part of his exhibition &ldquo;淑芳你好嘛 /Suk-Fong Nay Ho Mah / Suk-Fong, How Are You?&rdquo; at Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden in 2019, and provided an account of China&rsquo;s shifting cultural and political landscapes told through the personal perspectives of Wong&rsquo;s family, offering a unique understanding of China&rsquo;s transformation in the late-twentieth century.\r\n\r\nSaltwater City Vancouver/鹹水埠温哥华 is a Public Art project commissioned by the City of Vancouver Public Art Program in partnership with Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden, and is supported by The Prospero Group and the Audain Art Foundation.",

The subject of the work is a group of women who practice “square” or “plaza” dancing in the neighbourhood. The tradition has roots in both ancient and modern Chinese history, and is a popular exercise routine performed to music in squares, plazas and parks around the world. These local performances have been a consistent scene in the otherwise rapidly changing community of Cedar Cottage. The sessions occur most mornings in the tennis courts at Brewers Park, at the Cedar Cottage Community House, or other nearby locations. The sculpture depicts one of these dancers, Koco, in six poses, each pose distinct but merging into one another, atop a square base. The sculpture was produced using 3D scanning and printing technology to capture the dancer and her movements before the final bronze form.",

In this piece, Lyshaug reflects on home as a site for the intervention of the imaginary by presenting an image of a room that challenges the physical boundaries of space.The interjecting video of a quiet home exhibited in an ad-filled environment is a reversal of the usual flow of advertisements, which normally penetrates the domestic site through personal screens. The video simulates time as a projection of sunlight entering the home through a window and moving across an assemblage of walls. The slow pace of the artificial sunlight in the uninhabited space generates a dissonance: a meditative presence embedded within the cacophony of high stimulus messaging emitted by its surrounding advertisements.As a public artwork in Downtown Vancouver, this work takes on a larger cultural significance during the COVID-19 pandemic, when home-confinement is a part of collective experience. The health crisis has relocated shared experiences from crowded bars and sports arenas to isolated homes which are broadcasted as virtual public space through digital communication platforms. This uninhabited room becomes multiple through the eyes of each individual: the act of imaginary projection becomes a form of collective daydreaming.",

This public art shares the same title. Ging was working at a hotel near Chinatown and had just witnessed a crime. When the news crew arrived to cover the story, Ging was captured on film for several seconds. The family did not watch the news that evening, nor did they know that such footage existed. After the broadcast, the newsreel remained undiscovered in the CBC vault until Jeffery visited its archives decades later.\r\n\r\nJeffery&rsquo;s family research has been a long journey, chasing down documents and photographs to fill gaps not found in archives, and learning stories never shared by a silent generation. Inspired by this newsreel and the setting in which it would have been viewed, Jeffery researched photographs and interviewed family members to piece together how his grandparents&rsquo; living room appeared in 1964, and to learn about Ging, who died before Jeffery was born.\r\n\r\nMost of the furniture and household items are original to this room. The reproduction paintings were acquired using coupons from supermarket purchases. On the mantle, containers that once held Chinese vegetables and distilled spirits are displayed as decoration. Tin juice cans, aluminum pie plates, and a fruit crate are reused for houseplants. These items reflect the working class life of Ging, who held many jobs trying to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nThe living room is of the Mid-Century Builder vernacular, a modern, inexpensive, mass-produced housing option for working class families in the Lower Mainland. The emergence of the style paralleled the rise of television&rsquo;s popularity. The furniture placement is focused on how the family planned time together around the television. The clock, a wedding gift to Jeffery&rsquo;s grandparents, indicates 6:45, the time Ging appeared on television. The television is on but nobody is watching, symbolizing this almost forgotten newsreel, and how the past is fragile if not recorded, or passed down.\r\n\r\nHome Edition is the recreation of a time and a place, portraying Jeffery&rsquo;s family history, identity and values, and a reminder of how technology and the built environments of the past brought together families in a way that no longer exists.",

Each bench is inscribed with the name of one of the 14 women killed by a gunman on December 6th, 1989, at the l'Ecole Polytechnique, University of Montreal.  The benches are about the length and width of a woman's body and the depression in the center of each bench catches rain water, a reference to tears. A 98' diameter circle outside the benches is set w/ 500 7½\" square tiles with the names of donors.\r\nThe circle is situated close to the center of the park and makes reference to ancient stone circles. The space inside the circle is slightly domed and covered with grass. An alter-like podium stands just outside the circles and bears the name of the piece and an inscription. Over time, Marker of Change has quietly asserted itself into the consciousness of the community and has become a site for individual reflection and meditation as well as a place of discovery.",

                "artists_description": "It took nearly eight years for this monument to come into being. A committee was formed in conjunction with Capilano College and a subsequent national competition drew 98 entries. Toronto artist Beth Alber won with the design incorporating 14 pink granite benches in a circle.  It stands as a reminder of violence against women in society.  The competition policies state that, \"The Women's Monument is conceived as a rational monument to be located in Vancouver, BC, dedicated to all women who have been murdered by men, and naming the 14 women killed in Montreal on Dec 6,1989. It will provide a focus for healing and a tangible symbol of remembrance.\" Beth Alber's artist proposal states,  \"The circle, the symbol used by women for centuries to represent a continuum, in a non-hierarchical way, is one of the major elements for this Women's Monument. It is a symbol of women's spirit and is associated with the idea of a protected or consecrated space.\"  During the course of the project, considerable controversy was stirred up by the wording of the inscription which is dedicated to \"all women who have been murdered by men\".  Many people felt this inscription was too political. Some were critical about the eventual cost of the monument, approximately $500,000, which they felt could have been put to better purpose.  Many felt that the monument was too specific and was inappropriately sited in a public place, and that public money shouldn't be used to commemorate what was construed to be a private grief. But despite the obstacles, \"Marker of Change\" was unveiled in Thornton Park on December 6th, 1997 exactly eight years after the 14 women were killed.",

The work is site specific as it is based on research and archival material, as well as writings about this north shore of False Creek from pre-settlement time onwards. I have quoted from the City Archives, C.P. Railway Archives, anthropologists and poets to find words to sandcarve into 57 blocks of unpolished black granite. Set into pavers, they are like markers on a path (of time), an echo. Although I feel the words selected are specific to this place, they are also general, sometimes evocative, the ardent hope they will bring out a smile on rainy day.

The project was initiated by artist Alison Diesvelt who, together with the Southlands principal, identified Musqueam artist Debra Sparrow as a partner. Sparrow creates traditional weavings and indicated that she was interested in working on the community art piece. Out of community consultations and workshops, a mural was created with colours and patterns drawn from Musqueam visual traditions. Many community members participated in painting the school of salmon along the south wall near the main entrance and a community salmon barbecue was held to celebrate its completion. - Parks Board web site",

The structure of the artwork is a series of 10\"x10\"x60' steel columns that are arranged in such a way as to delineate a scaled down relationship to the 5 elevator shafts in the core of the building. The 5 elevator cars are represented in their respective positions on the columns. An interface with the actual elevator system in the building will cause the artwork cars to glide up and down the columns in exact co-relation to the real cars, ie, if only elevator #2 is used, and it is taken to the 16th floor, the artwork will respond accordingly, while the remaining cars stay idle.  Next, in each car in the building, placed under the pumpkin coloured carpet, will be a multi-contact membrane switch that will pick up the various passengers' foot prints as they stand or walk in the car, and transmit them out to an LED matrix screen on the underside of each corresponding artwork car.

The work consists of 16 in-ground and 4 above ground markers installed along the routes of four historical streams that once existed in Kitsilano. Each of the in-ground markers has the words LOST STREAM engraved around the outer edge. Each marker also contains engraved words on two themes; first, along the edges, two-word phrases for the agents of the demise of the stream e.g. \"Logging railway\" and second, in the centre, four kinds of plant and animal life that have disappeared e.g. \"sockeye, thimbleberry, lynx and fir\". Artist Marian Penner Bancroft writes, \"...my desire became to find a way of recalling what was now invisible, of marking the routes of the streams and in doing so to call up an earlier image of this place, to bring some history into the present... I also installed at (Kitsilano) Community Centre a set of black and white photographs, two for each (stream) path. These are close up images of where the streams once were, paired with images of trees that are fed by the underground flows, those vestiges of another landscape.\" -from the Vancouver Park Board web site",

                "artists_description": "Monument For East Vancouver develops from a graffiti symbol that has circulated for several decades in East Vancouver.  It is a symbol that has circulated in largely provisional terms.  My idea was to formalize the symbol through scale and permanence.  Although its precise origins are not known, the symbol does date back to at least the late 1940s (according to the memory of some senior citizens), which is the beginning of the post 2nd World War period.  Its roots may be linked to the Catholic inscription of East Vancouver culture at that time, home as it was to many Italians, Greeks and Eastern Europeans.  Over the years, the symbol has been adopted as an emblem for East Vancouver as a whole but its appearance has generally been tentative rather than overt.  The lack of overtness is, I feel, symptomatic of the underlying meanings that the symbol expresses.  These meanings have to do with problems of injustice, inequality, subjugation and the trauma of poverty and acculturation, particularly as it relates to immigrant life.  My proposal is for a site that sits on a visually messy and peripheral site in East Vancouver.  The East Vancouver symbol is rendered as a 57 foot sculpture that lights up after dark, the word East and Van encircled by a cross delineation that seems to float all on its own.  The sculpture faces westward towards downtown, towards the centre.  It is an expression of hope and defiance.",

The theme of flight seemed appropriate given the location too, for seaplanes are common sights at the entrance to the park.\r\n\r\nAnd the park, of course, is a place where children and adults may very well play with gliders… Plus it would be something that would be interesting when glimpsed only briefly by passengers in vehicles moving at relatively high speed along West Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe title of the work is meant to evoke, in a slightly humorous way…that of a classical modernist public monument of a bygone period, elements of which the sculpture plays with.",

A daily Flow concept developed by Fiona Bowie and Sidney Fels, based on using various components, such as time of day and weather, partially influences the behaviour of how images in the work appear. A system custom-designed by Bowie and Sidney Fels with Morgan Hibbert allows figures shot at different times to appear as if they are simultaneously present with a core group of these figures or actors recurring in a manner that implicitly suggests they&#39;re part of a larger narrative. Over the course of the day and night, Flow shifts between live and constructed or theatrical tableaus. During the early morning and after dusk Flow presents as a continuously changing tableau in which hundreds of photographic portraits and landscapes, shot by Fiona Bowie over a number of years, are blended and projected onto a special projection material, switch glass. As viewers come close to the image, the switch glass causes portions of the imagery to disappear as the surface of the glass panels &#39;switch&#39; from translucent to clear.  The scenes in Flow change every two to four minutes. The transitions from one scene to another are so slow that the work has been described as having a dream-like or hallucinatory quality. Because the projection system constantly varies the scale of images (between life size and zoomed in), a particular shot of a particular character may vary from scene to scene, seemingly either fore-grounded or backgrounded. During daylight hours, Flow&#39;s dynamic glass projection surface creates viewing portals, framing details of the activity inside and outside. This provides individuals inside with shifting views and details of the street (these views change according to their proximity to the street) and passersby are able to view activity going on inside the building.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\n\r\n\\tDeveloped Daily Flow concept (crows, weather): Fiona Bowie, Sidney Fels\r\n\\tInitial daily flow concept: Fiona Bowie, Sidney Fels, with Rebecca Belmore\r\n\\tPhotography and moving image, locations: Fiona Bowie\r\n\\tImage selection, Editing, Photography Post: Fiona Bowie\r\n\\tPortrait/Character/friend Diegesis: Fiona Bowie\r\n\\tSystem design: Sidney Fels, Fiona Bowie, Morgan Hibbert\r\n\\tCoding: Morgan Hibbert and Sidney Fels\r\n\\tSlow transitions, disappearing image/ switchglass concepts: Fiona Bowie\r\n\\tWebsite concept: Fiona Bowie \r\n\\tWebsite markup and design: Fiona Bowie \r\n\\tPut words in our mouths archive: Kay Higgins\r\n\\tProject and crew management: Fiona Bowie\r\n\\tLive switchglass execution and cam: Sidney Fels, Morgan Hibbert",

The Musqueam people have lived on their traditional territory – the land and waters now known as the lower mainland of BC encompassing the greater Vancouver region – for several thousands of years.  One of Musqueam’s most sacred sites, the Great Fraser Midden, is located just south of this site.\r\n\r\nThe sculpture was conceived by the artist to acknowledge this rich cultural history, the history of the Coast Salish people, and to (re)introduce the residents of this community to their neighbour ~ the Musqueam people.\r\n\r\nThe 14’ high water-jet cut aluminum sculpture, powder coated in copper and silver paint, is a contemporary Coast Salish design depicting salmon and river grass, which are representative of the Coast Salish people, and the Musqueam people in particular, and the salmon, once found in abundance in the nearby Fraser River.",

As this development sits in traditional Musqueam territory and is close to the banks of the Fraser River, my conceptual art piece is based on the theme of “people of the Grass” as well as the “Salmon People” which is uniquely Musqueam.  The human element within the salmon has universal appeal that symbolically relates to all peoples.  The faces are revealed with traditional Salish elements.  Overall, the forms represent a living thriving culture and our historical legacy; as well as this unique community today…giving a sense of place and a landmark that respects the past, present and future.",

(Examples of Musqueam weaving can be seen in the display case in front of the Safeway store along Granville street).  \r\n\r\nCreations in weaving have been passed down for countless generations.  The artists’ grandmother, Edna Grant, was taught to weave by her mother, who was taught by her mother, and so on. Her designs could be recognized up and down the coast.

Legends have been thought about time immemorial and passed on from generation to generation. They are contemporary tales because the story is always changing. An Eagle’s spirit, or the spirit of a bear is not always the same thing. Different characteristics and different places mean different things. Kelly and I have created a contemporary design that demonstrates the way nature flows together. In some cases you will see water flowing down a stream, or the wind blowing through the trees, or the trees themselves and their underground roots. Land is: blades of grass, a deer is prancing through from the forest just for the fun of it. A beaver emerges through the reeds at shore, looking for another tree to chew down; he has found it, but is weary of predators all the time. This time, only small creatures of the forest are hidden. Sea is: the west coast dream. Killer whales are chasing salmon around the Salish Sea. Kelp is flowing in the currents, maybe it is herring spawning season. Flounders down below are oblivious to another world above the surface. Cod are hiding amongst the rocks waiting for an easy meal. Life is transient, hardly still, even though we don't see it, branches are deliberately growing, underwater habitats are being bathed with the tide and water vapors rise into the atmosphere to fall far away. Happenings are all around us, ready to be re-discovered again and again. The broken circle of each design element refers to fragmented spindle whorl artifacts and the separations we see between these elements. Only when we see the whole picture together will the circle be complete. Our home is to inspire people to look closer in order to understand the subtleties and multitude of factors involved in our world.",

Combining materials and strategies used in advertising, the site-specific public artwork draws tangential connections between thoughtful inquiry and advertorial amusement. A pair of sunglasses from a 1970s fashion magazine is placed in the foreground of a celestial landscape from Mars, creating a scene that reads like a postcard from the future. In \"The Experience\", Zvonar continues her practice of appropriating imagery from various sources including advertising, contemporary fashion photography and counterculture media. She amplifies the digital design of her hand-cut collage by dramatically increasing its scale and incorporating lighting effects to produce an environment that shifts from a space of entertainment to one of examination.",

                "artists_description": "RIPPLES is a series of three screen-based animations created using a digital moiré technique. This animation technique is central to my practice; it consists in the overlapping of two images generating the illusion of a third image. Each work is produced using this method; two grids of pixels are overlapped and set in motion to generate a digital animated moiré. Alongside the use of digital moiré, the animations from RIPPLES display a common visual treatment: Streaks of hard-edged pixels combined to a minimal color palette. This visual treatment gives each animation unique graphical and kinetic qualities, reminiscent of early computer graphics and endemic to screens and matrix display technologies. The RIPPLES animations are initially shown on computer screens. They are published online as animated GIFs displayed full screen on HTML pages. The animations operate as seamless loops with no beginning or end; their duration online is determined by the viewer’s experience. Meanwhile, each animation encourages a contemplative gaze by combining textural and pixelated elements to a mesmerizing and infinite motion. Specifically, the animations from RIPPLES are informed by memories of rainstorm textures, sand patterns and ocean waves. Each animation attempts to emulate visual and behavioural qualities from these atmospheric elements into digital forms. This process happens slowly through a series of visual experimentations; when a visual experiment feels familiar with the natural references, it is developed to enhance and isolate these specific traits. The resulting works appear like distant recollections of the natural, fluctuating between organic form and digital abstraction. The space of the screen oscillates between depth and flatness, natural and synthetic, merging all into a hybrid form. The flat pixelated graphics flood the monitor, the endless motion does not give rest to the eye. The display becomes a reflecting pool; a space of contemplation on the presence and nature of screen technology.",

As our gaze peers off into the distance, imagination takes over reality… is site-specific public artwork that uses a photographic image of the surrounding site as raw material. The bottom of the image shows this imperfect photographic illusion, a proxy of objective reality, that becomes increasingly abstracted towards the top. The abstraction is a proxy for the constructive powers of imagination and is the result of a machine learning process that rearranges colour values according to their similarity. The imaginary structure presented in this image is both an emergent composition and an exposition of the implicit structure of reality. The image is a representation of place (as a physical location at the site of installation) and non-place (as an ambiguous and emerging structure under constant renewal). The viewer’s experience of the tension between ambiguity and reality mirrors the mind’s constant attempt to bridge experience and truth.",

It is a visual puzzle to be examined and contemplated ‘in the round.’ WHERENESS acknowledges an ancient human practice of piling rocks at certain points along pathways to guide travelers.

He didn't strike it rich and instead became a tax man and a steamboat pilot and later ran a saloon which is why he stands on a whiskey barrel. The Globe Saloon which stood on the site was reputedly built in 24 hours by the thirsty workers. (Vancouver Sun, April 7, 2001, H3) The nickname Gassy Jack came from the fact that he talked so much.

Cement and wood planks are interspersed with grass to create a walkway underneath the overhead track. The planks are reminiscent of a winding keyboard. The overhead track ends at the False Creek side with a row of 5 wooden barrels lined up like on an assembly line. Below the barrels is a board walk of 12 segments. Stepping on each board distinctly will cause steam to be forced through the barrels and out one side, creating a sound like a calliope on which you can play a tune. The sound harkens back to other times in relation to the contemporary sounds of the city which surround the piece.",

Each side of the square is 15' long by 3'  high by 3' wide. The bottom side appears to be cut apart in the middle and the two parts wrenched apart to form a gate or arch.  The corten steel is designed so that the surface rust forms a protective coating.  There was some adverse reaction from Kits Point residents when the work was installed. Michael Duncan, Chief Curator of the Maritime Museum at the time, called it \"a bloody monstrosity.\" An article in the Globe and Mail teased that it could be \"the world's largest paper clip.\" The article (Mar3, 1981) also quoted from a city planning study which read: \"Vancouver's peerless natural setting is a permanent gift from nature. So massive and close are the North Shore mountains that no amount of human folly can ever obliterate them.\"  But the controversy soon abated and the piece has weathered time and opinion. It was vandalized on July 4th, 1988, when a field of white dots were painted on its surfaces -probably as an art \"intervention\". The dots were soon removed. Since then, the \"Gate to the Northwest Passage\" has become a familiar landmark, an important place marker which stands guard at the entrance to False Creek. The area around the site is a favorite for kite flyers.",

The competition guidelines (1979) specified a sculpture made of permanent materials, \"not wood,\" and that it should not be in the likeness of a man. The form of the work takes off from two 18th century navigational instruments: the plane table and David's quadrant.  Chung Hung said that, \"The objective of the sculpture is to create a symbolic image with definite visual expression, awakening an awareness in Captain George Vancouver's contribution to the world, his remarkable and meticulous surveys which included the north Pacific coast.\" The piece frames English Bay from the north view and the Centennial Museum from the south view. The opportunity for a sculpture was offered to the city by Hugh Faulkner, Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs at the time. The project was recommended by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.  A five-member jury headed by former parks superintendent Stuart Lefeaux selected Chung Hung's proposal from a local competition and the Parks Board approved the choice. Gordon Smith, a member of the selection panel, said that \"If people think Hung's sculpture is a poor catch, they should have seen the ones that got away.\"  It was originally to be sited at Ferguson Point in Stanley Park.",

While I wished to contrast with the building's weight and greyness, and to amplify the theme of living growth represented in the tree plantings in the west half of the lobby, I also wanted the mural to be more than an appropriate decorative design. I wanted some image capable of appealing to the imagination of those who would use the lobby every day so that they would not tire of it and therefore become oblivious to it. What better than a great \" primavera \" for Spring to cheer the spirit? And what more impressive than a large sculptural relief in full colour? And what more poetically exuberant as a permanent symbol than two splendid butterflies breaking from the white cocoon of Spring - the one on the left an abstraction of pieces coming together to form the insect and the one on the right a full-fledged realization? It is hoped that once the mind is focussed in this direction a certain transformational process is suggested and with it certain mythological overtones might unfold. The cocoon may then become the violet and white mythic egg from which Spring is born. The symbolic bird and flowers now become the guardians of this ritual birth of new life, this PRIMAVERA.",

By age 18 he became the first man to hold the record in both the 100 yard and the 100 metre runs. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he and his sister and their friend Paul Winn were the only black athletes in track in the Canadian National Championships. He ran in three Olympic competitions. In the 1960 Rome Olympics he collapsed on the track with a severely torn hamstring and was labeled a \"quitter\" by the press. He set another world record in 1962 but later had another fall when his left quadricep muscle group was completely severed.  After surgery and recovery he went on to win the Bronze medal in the 100 metre race at the Tokyo Olympics. Before his retirement in 1968 at 28, he established six world records. He was named BC's Athlete of the Century.  Afterwards he created manuals and sports programs for young people. He received the Order of Canada in 1972 and died suddenly at age 42 in 1982.",

The route taken to that information can guide the thought process and determine the end conclusions. Leonardo realized this a few centuries ago; Our concept is to challenge users of the facility to rethink their thought processes. \r\nThe most opportune time to accomplish this is before entering the Library - confronting the viewer by having them walk through the piece - and perhaps encouraging them to leave their previous perceptions at the door.\r\nThe format in presenting the concept is another Leonardo da Vinci exercise - a geometric discovery of form, mathematics and order. Our interpretation of the exercise challenges the viewer's perceptions: first, by engaging the individual in a visual puzzle that defines the various elements of the geometry in a manner that also juggles their perceptions; and secondly, by making visual references to the cosmos that will take the viewer beyond the physical piece to consider the mysteries of the mind, universe, and of course, the search for truth.\r\nIn locating the piece at, and as the entrance, it emphasizes Public Art as a functioning componenet of life and architecture - the concept challenging one's thought process and the physical statement aiding in the flow and function of the ordered architecture.",

At its peak 100,000 to one million people spoke the language from the Pacific coast to the Rocky Mountains, from Northern California to the Alaskan panhandle.

The mosaics, set on a concrete base, are flush with the ground and flat across the surface, symbolically representing the surface of water. The park also includes a herb garden with a mosaic border designed by Glen Andersen and Marina Szijarto and wooden benches and a basalt pillar play area designed by Sarah White.",

(A group called Britiannia Neighbours formed to organize a public design process and to fundraise for the park.) During the design process there were a number of ideas related ot water, none of which turned out to be feasible. Therefore, a symbolic representation was proposed - a mosaic creek. The intent was to involve as many community members as possible in making an art project which whould symbolize the notion of contributing one's individual expression and at the same time being part of a larger whole. There was no official theme or requirements except material specifications, I.e., frost-proof tile, type of glue, and spacing of tiles for grout allowance during installation. Approx. 500 people participated in the project (over 4,000 volunteer hours!).",

The Emily Carr students created animal and plant images interpreting the poems that were used as borders for the poems. Later these were cast in bronze. The bronze Poem Markers line the newly created pathway that runs along side the Renfrew Ravine. Renfrew Ravine poles created from drawings of flora and fauna from the ravine were crafted from computer-laser technology. These forms were attached to 30-foot high faceted cedar poles and welcome visitors at both entrances to the Renfrew Ravine pathway.",

Two centuries of activity are traced in time from left to right.\"  (information sheet from the Maritime Museum)   In the upper left, the \"Lions\" represent the geographic outlook of Vancouver. The activity on the sea is represented by images of First Nations peoples and their canoes and Captain George Vancouver and his ship Discovery along with Valdes and Galiano and their ships Sutil and Mexicana from 1792.The image also shows Captain GH Richards who surveyed the area and his ship Plumber as well as the Beaver, the first steamship on the coast, a Hudson Bay Company supply vessel, along with others. In the diamond in the centre of the image is the Empress of Japan and its famous dragon figurehead which is in the Museum's collection.  Modern freighters and luxury steamers complete this section of the picture. The Lions Gate Bridge, built in 1939, is depicted, as is the St Roch, the RCMP patrol vessel that worked the North-West Passage in the early 1940s, which is housed in the Maritime Museum. Also shown are the Ivanhoe and the Master, wood-hulled tugs from the early 20th century. The harbour is depicted by Canada Place with its cruise ship facility and the Saskatchewan Grain Pool elevator and a Japanese freighter. The people who work in the harbour are also shown, identifiably Joe Fortes, the legendary English Bay lifeguard.

                "artists_description": "\"The inspiration for Time Top came from a comic strip by William Ritt and Clarence Gray called The Time Top that the artist read as a child. In it’s last episode, the Time Top was slowing down over the ocean . . . And the artist has picked up the story line from there and is presenting this sculpture as “a relic of reality, building on the idea of an alternative reality which we each share with a broad diversity. “ A comic book describing the artist’s creative and fabrication processes will be published to coincide with the opening event scheduled for early October 2006.\r\nAfter being fabricated out of silicon bronze by the Harman Foundry in Sechelt, BC, Time Top was submerged into the ocean water at Gibsons, BC for two years. While submerged, it was connected to an electrical power supply which delivered a low voltage charge to the bronze causing it to attract a deposition of seawater minerals on to it’s surface forming a crust. This process is known as “Electro-deposition of minerals in seawater” or accretion. When the accretion process was complete,\r\nthe sculpture was fitted with a polycarbonate dome and now stands 13 feet tall and 10 feet wide. A series of granite cap stones, inscribed with images from the original comic strip, have been installed along the sea wall in front of the sculpture. The sculpture fabrication was completed after the artist’s death in 2003 by a team led by Margaret Pethick, Jerry’s wife, according to his fully documented drawings, specifications and nstructions.\" - press release, Maureen Smith, Concord Pacific, August 2006",

                "artists_description": "Riding high among the rooftops in Vancouver is an unusual sight that awaits the casual viewer looking upward from street to sky; a 58 inch-high bright copper sculpture of a historical-looking figure riding a lively horse with a ringleted mane, reading a book while sitting backwards. The figure faces the direction of the wind as indicated by the four directionals and the tipped arrow upon which it rests. Closer investigation reveals this to be Rodney Graham’s Weathervane sculpture, which depicts the artist dressed as 16th Century humanist and classical scholar, Erasmus. Absorbed in the solitary activity of reading, the figure is lost in thought and contemplation, not having to worry about where he is going or what lies ahead but, as Rodney Graham puts it, is able to ‘ponder on horseback’  moving forward but also looking backward, to the past.  Rodney Graham based the weathervane on a contemporary anecdote which claimed that Erasmus wrote his most well-known work, The Praise of Folly, on horseback during a journey from Italy to England circa 1510. Graham plays on the absurdism inherent in reading a philosophical treatise on human folly whilst riding on a horse backwards and continues his ongoing philosophical enquiry into cyclical and backward movement; like all his work it contains a complex narrative and is brimful of references: literary, philosophical, self-referential and art historical.  Rodney Graham’s poetic and humourous weathervane, helpfully indicating wind direction and compass points for any serious traveller who looks upward to contemplate the conditions for travel, continues his preoccupation with un-urgent journeying. Erasmus travels from Italy to England leisurely by horseback, the cowboy meanders gently off the beaten track, the buccaneer’s unknown voyage which has thrown him up on a “treasure island”, and the chemically-induced mental journeys that take place in the artist’s head, remind us even if we are not going anywhere in particular that ‘the trip is the thing’.\r\n(Rodney Graham in conversation with Iwona Blazwick, Director, Whitechapel Gallery, October 14th 2008\r\n2 Rodney Graham in Rodney Graham, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London 2002 p.109)",

It was important that the work be read at a distance as well as have some aspect of the work that would be more intimate in its relationship to the viewer and the site.  The intention was to create an iconic sculpture acting as a gateway marker defining the entrance to the City of Vancouver. turn acts as an identifier of place, creating an image in the viewer’s mind that connects them back to the site. The imagery and form for turn evolved from ideas about “driving” and “fixing” in particular, with the final form of the sculpture column based upon the twist drill. The two ground elements were intended to provide a more intimate relationship to the site as well as to the scale of the viewer.",

The Solar Bike Tree is sited at Science World, close to the 2010 Olympics Athletes' Village. It sits at the confluence of three major cycle paths, including the city's premiere Central Valley Greenway. The Solar Bike Tree replaces a street lamp at the end of an arc of large trees in planters, becoming one of the “trees” in effect. The round hoops of the tree’s canopy echo the spherical shape of Science World. BC Hydro funded the solar component of the piece and Webster Solar Energy was the solar consultant.",

The Solar Bike Tree turns a bike rack into a work of art, making it cool to ride and park your bike and perhaps more desirable to have a bike rack in front of businesses or in public spaces. By turning a bike rack into a sculpture, we hope to bring more attention to \"alternative transportation\" in this time of rising fuel costs and peak oil concerns. It also gives bike owners a safer, more theft and vandal-resistant way to securely park their bikes. –Spring Gillard",

The contributed messages in English were selectively translated into Skwxwú7mesh; Kwak’wala and h?n’q’emin’?m’ and these, along with messages resulting from workshops with urban Aboriginal youth, completed the launch of the project. The billboard itself became an artistic and literary space for exchange between native and non-native communities exploring how language is used in advertising, its tactical role in colonization, and as a complex vehicle of communication. Encouraging dialogue among artists and writers, between First Nations and non-First Nations communities, and between artists, writers and the public, Digital Natives is public art that the public not only ‘receives’, but also produced. Local and remote audiences were welcomed to tweet their messages to @diginativ, and they were considered for broadcast.

The work is intended as a self-conscious reflection upon the idea of development and demonstrates a simple yet evocative response to the notion of progress and achievement. Much of my work deals with the semiotics of the built world. It tries to find a contingent position in between the idea of development and urbanism.

Through a process of inquiry and research, the artists draw heavily on individual and shared narratives within the founding DTES cultural groups including the Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh and Musqueam Nations, and African, Chinese, Japanese and European settlers.  In addition to a large public mural on Hastings Street, Soul Gardens created a dynamic online interface inviting individuals to share recipes, stories, photos and other information about how food played a role in shaping their experience of Vancouver.",

The steel fence, with its grids and rivets that delineate the eyes, mouths and fins of the whales and the salmon, represents a type of vessel similar to the ships that anchor at Port Metro Vancouver—the destination of the majority of the trucks driving along the street below the artwork. The sculpture depicts two sets of stylized whales facing opposite directions with their tale flukes meeting in the centre. The whales pursue salmon cascading down the slope towards the North Shore mountains.",

This public artwork is inspired by Old Faithful and other natural water spouts arising from geological pressures under the earth’s surface. \r\n\r\nA natural geyser is a spectacle that brings attention to what is going on below the surface of things. As a public monument, Geyser for Hillcrest Park replicates this sense of wonder and acts as a spontaneous reminder of underlying forces at work on the site. It is a civic “natural wonder” that makes the green initiatives of the building apparent for all to see. It is not a fountain that operates with a recycling pump. The Geyser acts according to the rhythms and needs of the community, as evidenced by the levels and flow of water through the site. The geyser spray is around 15 feet in height. The duration of the spray is determined by the amount of water needed to fill the tank. The run-off from the Geyser is connected to the grey water cistern in the Hillcrest facility. This cistern is used for all the building’s non-potable water needs, including flushing toilets and irrigation throughout the park grounds. The cistern is fed by collected rainwater from the roof and some grey water from underground sources. However, when the water in the cistern is low, it draws on the city’s drinkable water supply. This is where the Geyser comes in. It is incorporated into this water “loop\" so that clean potable water needed to top up the cistern will first be propelled out through the Geyser and then flow back to the cistern as grey water.",

            "description": "SeeSawSeat is a public artwork by Germaine Koh that crosses a bus bench with a teeter-totter. Waiting for the bus is transformed from a passive pause into a modest social activity. Made of wood and metal and resembling the benches in Vancouver's bus shelters, the artwork is located in close proximity to an existing transit shelter with an integral bench making the visual references clear.A transit bench as teeter-totter creates a playful situation full of possibilities for interaction and negotiation. Uncomfortable when used by only one person, the artwork is best experienced with another person and thus becomes a tool for whimsical social exchange.SeeSawSeat is built with the fulcrum of the bench slighly to one side, so that when then bence is unoccupied, it drops to one side, a clear sign that it is not a fixed bench. The highest point of teh 8-foot-long bench is approximately 28\" above grade when fully tilted.SeeSawSeat was one of three public art projects developed through the Main Street Urban Transportation Showcase (UTS), a plan to encourage reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and more energy efficient transportation practices by improving pedestrian and transit services along Main Street. As part of the Main Street UTS, an art plan was created which led to the commissioning of three public art projects to be installed in the Main Street corridor, including temporary artworks for three Main Street articulated trolley buses. Artists were selected by a panel consisting of three art professionals, and one representative each from Translink and City of Vancouver.This artwork is part of a transit and corridor improvement project and funding partnership between Translink, the City of Vancouver and the Federal Government",

Functioning as a sign on the building, the letters are rendered in a font designed by the artists which references the motif of a formal trellis structure employing trompe l'oeil techniques to create illusory depth and space. The spacing between the words in the phrase is based on a section of a Fibonacci sequence - reinforcing notions of the ideal, perfection and pragmatism which Voltaire explored so richly in Candide.",

In particular, elk forms a crucial aspect of First Nations subsistence and spiritual economies. In the artist’s Lakota Sioux community they hold power as a source of sacred mana integral to ceremonial life. Elk were plentiful in the lower mainland for thousands of years, yet have disappeared in less than two hundred.  Today the local Musqueam people must trade up north and in the interior for elk, as their use remains intrinsic to the society and culture. \r\n\r\nThe artist questions: “What does this mean for society today? How are we respecting the “four-leggeds” still among us? What is our relationship with them?  Who is responsible for considering them and making sure they are safe? How do we live with them?”  She asks us to ponder these questions as we look through the grey concrete forest to see the aestheticized elk, alive in a celebration of colour, where it once may have been standing.",

The original idea was to present a true ratio of buildings lost to buildings recorded in the process of being lost, thus incorporating the notion of \"absence\" into the final piece.

A fritted glass pattern comprised of over 1,000 crosses on each large panel of glass are repeated across the windows of the church facility. Nine different intuitive arrangements of crosses, three arrangements for each of the three colours, create an overall, organic, swarming pattern. The architecture appears porous as light passes through the windows and the shadows of the crosses spill across the interior surfaces.",

Along with the intuitive arrangements of the crosses, which create a contrast to the rigid grid of the building, these organic swarms of crosses seek to visually erode the architecture making it more porous, almost formless, allowing for a gentler interface with its surroundings.Similar to ambient music, with an emphasis on tone and atmosphere over structure and rhythm, “RGB” seeks to reflect the diversity and inclusiveness of the Central Presbyterian Church and the surrounding West End community.",

The intersecting glass creates a plinth, with the boulder suspended at eye level. The work seeks to reflect the seemingly static yet ever-changing relationship between the climate and our physical environment. The rock and its reflection floats, as if mirroring the moving planet, an expression of the measure of time, weight and value, contrasting with its surroundings and the sky to create its own unique ecology.",

The time-lapse super 8 film documents the urban coastline from Crab Park on the city's Downtown Eastside to Kits Beach. Using a bicycle specially adapted to hold a vintage super 8 camera, she makes her way along the seawall and then edits the film segments into a high speed tour of the perimeter of the city.",

The former salt marsh next to the Ironworker’s Memorial Bridge early on had a swimming pool that was filled by the tide. When the waters became polluted by industry, a new pool was built. Waterfowl adapted and settled in the pool through the winter months. Now there is an initiative to turn the edge back into a salt marsh. The film contemplates the site as a pivotal place of contestation between the natural and industrial forces of the coastal city.",

                "artists_description": "In 1971, a health inspector deemed the water in the tidal pool located at New Brighton Park to be unsafe, due to industrial pollution in the Burrard Inlet. A new pool was built the following year and continues to be open to the public from May to September. For the rest of the year, the pool remains filled and waterfowl are allowed to use it, fenced off and protected from human disturbance. As natural processes adapt around sites of conservation as well as industrial sites, each one becomes naturalized in itself, blurring the area between the natural and the artificial. The turning point of anthropogenic influence can be seen as the moment at which an external dependency occurs, and environmental stewardship and conservation efforts to counteract the effects of industry are a prime example of this. New Brighton Park has been an institution of northeast Vancouver for over a century, but the park itself is in a state of change. There has been a recent proposal to reclaim the shore and field next to and including the tennis courts, to transform this area back into a salt marsh. The park’s location creates an ideal vantage point to frame the emblematic and historic aspects of Vancouver in the contemporary moment. Tidal Pool documents New Brighton Park in its contemporary state, as a point of articulation between natural adaptation and global industry.",

                "artists_description": "Underneath Main and Terminal and extending back towards present-day Clark Drive existed a biologically rich lagoon and marsh area that was used by the Tsleil-Waututh, Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish) and xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) Nations since time immemorial. The area was covered over to make room for Industry and the CPR railway. The attempted erasure of the space by the colonial forces of the time was thorough and it continues to be built upon today. When looking at some of the public art in Vancouver and other cities we often see a romantic depiction of industrial beginnings and labour. What existed before is often covered and ignored. Knowing that my work will live in this space temporarily I feel it is important to acknowledge its history as well as its present-day. Vancouver is built upon unceded land, sacred sites, complex river and stream systems, hunting and cultivated gathering grounds. It is easy to get lost in the feeling of permanence that urban structures hold. The areas we walk, drive and live upon have place-names and a history of lived experiences.I have lived in Vancouver on and off for around 17 years. Since moving here I have been trying to understand my relationship with this place. I am of mixed Coast Salish ancestry (Klahoose and Sliammon) from my grandmother Agnes Pielle, as well as Wuikinuxv and Kwakwaka'wakw from my grandfather Johnny Hanuse. As a youth I learned that my Grandmother's Nations were historically unified with the Nations here and visually our iconography shares links. The relationship between Nations experienced rupture as a result of colonization. Visually it is important for me to work in continuum with my ancestors. It is also important for me to note that these images do not represent the space they will temporarily live upon, but reflect a relationship and respect for the land and water that my ancestors carried. I strive to continue in this mode of reverence for the spaces we come from and live upon. I also want to recognize my place as an uninvited guest in this space and continue to gain further understanding of it in my time here.An important part of the process in making these pieces has been listening. I have been in conversation with Skwxw’u7mesh artist/knowledge keepers T'uy'tanat (Cease Wyss) and her partner Xuuyaa, as well as other respected community members in the lead up to installing these pieces. I am grateful for their generosity of time and guidance.",

With colour, comfort, and curiousity leading, objects were chosen for their familiarityor for their particular presence. Each of the thirty-five, 5 x 8- foot glass panels is a composition created in colour stages. The inside viewer (hospital community or patients and staff?) is/are able to examine objects in detail over a 35 foot, colour-changing walkway mural, while the public art viewer sees an expanded version as colour spectrums spanning up five floors.Culled from her collection of jewel-toned glass objects and augmented by flea market finds and borrowed treasures, this giant-sized still life creates a spectrum of colour that is projected into the building in the afternoon and glows at night in a building-sized lightbox. Like large photographic slides, the transparent panels are mounted to a series of glass walkways that make up one wall of the internal atrium. The murals transform the hallways with the changing light, allowing inside viewers to experience a “colour walk” as the sun projects the art into the building and onto the light colored floor.",

                "artists_description": "The artwork responds to the architectural and cultural context of the VPLʼs new nəә́ca̓ ʔmat ct Strathcona Branch Library. It aims to highlight a sense of community despite visible economic and cultural diversity of the neighbourhood. The form is inspired by animals from the Strathcona neighbourhood, the historical precedent of narrative bronze doors in relief, and the phenomenon of “Head in the Hole” photo boards. Conceptually, it responds to the colour and texture in the community (particularly the murals), and the desire to identify oneself as part of a community. Bronze doors are heavy and have a ceremonial quality. Often covered in narrative reliefs, they are an early form of storytelling. What is the narrative here at the Library? The name, nəә́ca̓ ʔmat ct, loosely translates as “we are one” in the Musqueam language, and the artwork responds to this sentiment. Introducing animals into the artwork is a way to identify all the library patrons as “one” across a loose geographic area without picking out and representing cultural differences which, while is important to celebrate diversity, becomes tricky when it becomes a symbol of ownership and belonging. We all have an innate desire see ourselves in the world around us and understand that we belong somewhere. Through identifying with a character, a cultural symbol or in the capturing of a moment that contains us (the selfie), we place ourselves within acertain context. The artwork takes the form of ʻHead in holeʼ photo board to create a situation in which people of all ages can simultaneously identify with a character/animal, and see themselves within it. It is a sculptural activation of the imaginative process involved in reading. The holes provide the opportunity to see yourself in the mirror as the animal from a distance, or they invite you to peer inside.",

Elements from selected photographs were reconfigured to build an impossible architectural structure growing out of a landscape destroyed by logging. Excavations expresses the challenge of piecing together a complete history through the archive and its inherent biases, while also retaining the complexity of Vancouver’s history and ever-changing built environment.After reviewing a large selection of the city’s archival photographs, certain narratives around settlement and industry persisted in the historical documentation. Given Vancouver’s extensive pre-colonial, Indigenous history, questions regarding the under-represented communities and narratives in the archive informed the artist’s approach to producing the image. What history can be understood and given form when the archival material reflects a certain vantage point?Looking at the historical photographs, it is difficult to situate their locations within the city due to the dramatic changes that have occurred in Vancouver’s evolution from a frontier town to a major international hub. With the urban renewal programs of the 1960s, the development of the waterfront for Expo 86, the current housing bubble, amongst many other changes, the city of Vancouver is in constant flux. The majority, if not all, of the buildings used to create this image no longer exist, pointing to the disappearance of countless older properties, creating an historical amnesia. This explicit sense of disorientation and dislocation is represented in the destabilized structure of Excavations.",

Most of this “waste” is considered valuable resource material that could have been conserved, reused, recycled or composted instead of sent to the landfill or incinerator.New Delhi-based artist Asim Waqif’s site-specific installation at Offsite combines architecture with a strong contextual reference to contemporary urban design and the politics of urban waste management. Concerns of the environment and social responsibility weave through his work, and for this project Waqif has created an immersive architectural experience built out of materials collected from repurpose stores, the transfer station and landfill in the metro Vancouver area. The structure is assembled using timber, roofing, doors, window frames and sections of walls salvaged from recent demolitions and discarded from local residential and office building.Many of Waqif’s projects respond to an absence of a tactile, experiential aspect in contemporary art by establishing an element of interactivity inside a living, evolving, organic environment. At Offsite he installs mechanical and electronic panels into his maze-like structures to cultivate a multi-sensory experience with sound, light and movement. Visitors are encouraged to move through the installation, allowing them to activate the architecture. This is the artist’s first exhibition in Canada. - Courtesy of the Vancouver Art Gallery",

                "artists_description": "Building A - Livestock Building is an infrared photograph of the 1929 Livestock Building located on the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) fairgrounds. The image has been captured by a thermal imaging camera, normally used by the construction industry, which has been designed to display differences in temperature by detecting light rays that are invisible to the human eye.Most PNE fairgoers are familiar with the Livestock Building, entering through one of its many barn doors along its south side to cheer on the baby pig races, pet the chickens, llamas and rabbits, and ogle animals large and small. What is not so evident when wandering through this expansive space was its change of use in 1942 when the grounds, then known as Hastings Park, were expropriated by the Department of National Defense.With the declaration of war against Japan, the Government of Canada evoked the War Measures Act and authorized removal of “all persons of Japanese racial origins,” from the west coast “protected area” of British Columbia, even though the majority were Canadian born and Naturalized Canadians. Some 22,000 Japanese Canadians, then labeled “enemy aliens,” were uprooted from their homes and sent to various sites, including internment camps, road construction camps and sugar beet farms in the BC interior, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario. All personal properties, such as fishing boats, farms, businesses and homes, were confiscated and sold without owners’ consent to cover the costs of their internment.Beginning in March 16, 1942, some 8,000 persons, removed from fishing, lumber and mining villages along the north coast and Vancouver Island, were held at Hastings Park while campsites to which they were eventually transferred were being developed. The stables and cattle stalls of the Livestock Building were converted into a makeshift women and children’s dormitory. Other structures were used as boys and men’s dorms, mess halls, kitchen, hospital and isolation ward. Young men were separated from their families, and sent to work at road camp sites. By September, 1942, there were 3,866 women, men and children living in various buildings on thissite.The archival photograph is from a series that local photographer LeonardFrank was contracted to document for the BC Security Commission, which was created in 1942 to oversee the internment process. This image portrays the interior of the Livestock Building, with bedsheets dividing the living quarters. The thermal photograph suggests a way of seeing what is no longer obvious or visible to us today.",

As part of the residency Wong created a series of artworks based on 700+ letters in Chinese sent by 90 writers to his mother Suk-Fong Wong, as well as other familial artefacts such as her Chinese medicine collection and photos. The artist also presented a series of programs and workshops with other artists and community members that included a pride event, artist talks, and a series of Chinese herb and medicine workshops.\r\n\r\nThe letters and artworks were presented as part of his exhibition &quot;淑芳你好嘛 /Suk-Fong Nay Ho Mah / Suk-Fong, How Are You?&quot; at Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden in January 2019, and provided an account of China&rsquo;s shifting cultural and political landscapes told through the personal perspectives of Wong&rsquo;s family, offering a unique understanding of China&rsquo;s transformation in the late-twentieth century. The project was also documented through the website www.occupyingchinatown.com and will include a forthcoming publication. The city&rsquo;s Public Artwork &ldquo;Saltwater City Vancouver/鹹水埠温哥华&rdquo;now located in the alleyway of 475 Main street was also developed as part of Wong&rsquo;s 身在唐人街/OCCUPYING CHINATOWN project.",

They create material scenes referring to the realms of the domestic, work, industrial, craft, and entertainment. These unfurl over the course of each day into the evening, sparely suggestive of the human dramas to which these materials are normally the backdrop.

There has always been a deep appreciation of those who came before me tending to the land in such a way that even now natural beauty is a defining feature in a teeming city. The ancestors and spirit that sits deep in the land are always very apparent to me. I wanted this art then to reflect this and also to be fantastical — to engage both the land and the imagination.I used big colours that match dusk and dawn, I brought in highlights of the old meeting the new (the cherry blossoms versus the cedar), I focused on iconic landscapes within the geography that is Vancouver.  I depicted animals that we share space with everyday and perhaps do not see.  If you look close, you can identify them. I wanted to explore our connections with ancestors and spirit and life.\"",

                "artists_description": "\"Inspired by Henry David Thoreau’s essay “Civil Disobedience” (1849), Wurm’s Big Disobedience, (2016) makes reference to an often explored theme: political and social correctness. Related in its use of the human form and apparel, Half Big Suit (2016) stems from an earlier series, Cut, that investigates the fragmented body. Fixed in an awkward position, with one leg extended in the air, the static sculpture conveys a sense of distress experienced while undergoing a durational performance or holding a lengthy pose. In their focus on the body and its motions, these works relateto Wurm’s famous One Minute Sculptures series (XXXX), in which viewers enact simple yet absurd poses for one minute at a time.The relationship between the organic transformation of the body through biological factors and the intentional moulding of objects in Wurm’s work is illustrated in his architectural structure, Flat Iron (2016). Here the artist’s distorted recreation of New York’s iconic Flatiron Building is demonstrated in a melting structure, demonstrating further how the manipulation of volume, scale, form and materiality, can signal transformation in both human and non-human form.Inspired by Wurm’s performative practice, the Gallery invited Mike Bourscheid, an artist who works between Luxembourg and Vancouver, to develop a series of performative interventions at Offsite: Erwin Wurm.\" - Vancouver Art Gallery",

The resulting pyramid is a monumental pile of oranges which are largely uniform in scale but that reveal subtle differences from one orange to the next. In conceiving of this work, Falk revisited her brilliantly glazed ceramic fruit piles of the 1960s, suggestive of grocery store fruit displays. Unlike her earlier ceramic piles, 900 Oranges takes on a new tactility through its presentation in bronze; ripe fruits are soft and transitory but here are represented by a material that is permanent and that resonates through history.",

                "artists_description": "In the grand scheme of Vancouver’s heritage, the neon period from 1925 to 1960 is perhaps the city’s most heralded example of its transition from gloomy sawmill town to vibrant metropolis. At the peak of this glowing epoch there were thousands of electrified gas filled glass tubes in the Terminal City’s neon jungle. A big hiccup in this brightlights-big-city story came with the blackouts of WWII when civil defence restrictions lead to a new category of no neon outdoor advertising known as “Spectaculars.”When McGavin’s Bakery approached Neon Products for an animated neon of Mother Hubbard’s bread, a “Spectacular” was suggested instead. A hand of enormous proportions was proposed, roughly the same size as the Statue of Liberty’s, but instead of grasping the eternal flame of freedom, Mother Hubbard’s digits would raise on high a leviathan loaf of liberty bread! Genius! McGavin’s, a big supporter of Victory Bonds, approved.Ironically, work on the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf didn’t begin until after blackout restrictions had been lifted at the end of the war. Progress slowed when McGavin’s roof required fortification supporting the added weight. Then the “Spectacular” installers were unavailable, preoccupied by a Log Cabin Cookies billboard featuring a real log cabin with smoking chimney and Mom inside whipping up maple creams. Finally in September 1948, the “Spectacular” crew convened on the roof of McGavin’s and over the next four months assembled the sheet metal loaf and concrete mixed with vermiculite hand, and a cuff hiding the steel bridgework. The finished Giant Hand &amp; Loaf stood atop McGavin’s bakery from 1949 through 1973.When Henri Robideau photographed the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf in February 1973, its cuff had blown away in a wind storm and one of its fingers had rotted off. This image became the first in his life-long photographic study of humanity’s attraction to bigness, a new science he called Gianthropology. He conducted Gianthropological Digs along the Pacific cordillera throughout the 1970’s, culminating in the 1980 exhibition Giant Things, featuring the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf as its signature image. Expanding on that huge success he launched the Pancanadienne Gianthropological Survey, portaging around Canada in the 1980’s, photographing the monumental in the form of panoramic images.",

The name is a pun on the nature of neon, as literally light made from gas.\r\n\r\nThe design of the sign was inspired by the title card for the 1940 film Gaslight. With the film&rsquo;s success, the term &quot;gaslighting&quot; was adopted in psychology to refer to a form of abuse in which the victim is covertly manipulated into doubting their own memory, perception, judgement, and eventually their sanity. More recently this term has been used to describe the manipulation of an entire society through misinformation and destabilizing the concept of truth. \r\n\r\nIn the current context fractured by a global public health pandemic, the inequalities of late capitalism, the violence of systemic racism, and a looming catastrophic climate crisis, the term &quot;gaslighting&quot; has re-emerged as a powerful signifier and imminent warning of the gap between perception and reality.",

Embedded in black mosaic cladding the nine mosaic figural silhouette drawings will be on both faces of the columns. Some figures will be fully viewed from the outside while others will be more visible from the interior of the building. The mosaic figures will be scaled to the full height of each column face. Central to the proposition of these large-scale outdoor drawings is a concern for what I consider to be drawing&rsquo;s most essential quality; the material presence of line. The rich and long tradition of mosaics is its engagement with and consideration for, process, material and line. A material and process based approach means the drawing must not only be responsive to the architecture, but germane to the community and pertinent to the site. These figural, columnar figures will be captured as modern day caryatides. A considered presence, the figures will be defined and be understood by both the present activities and people that surrounds them today as well as from those the past (history of Leslie House). Solitary and reaching, these gentle and quiet giants will be formidable but not intimidating, abstract yet recognizable, subscribers to no other narrative but the one passersby and visitors choose to impose. Personnages will bear the weight of our unremarkable quotidian and our extraordinary shared existence.\r\n\r\nVisit Grosvenor Pacific&#39;s webpage to learn more: https://art.grosvenorpacific.com/",

                "artists_description": "A new city hall and a statue of Captain George Vancouver were commissioned to commemorate Vancouver's Golden Jubilee in 1936. The architect of the new City Hall at Strathcona Park on West 12th Avenue, Fred Townley, proposed the sculpture, commissioned by the Vancouver Canadian Club, be placed on the plaza on the north side of the building. Noted BC sculptor, Charles Marega, was commissioned (for about $5500) to create a life-size sculpture of the man who mapped the harbour in 1792 and after whom the city is named. \r\nMarega began by setting up 500 pounds of clay on a turntable in his Hornby Street Studio. From the clay model, he made a plaster cast which was then used to cast the finished work in \"Roman bronze\". It was cast at Ornamental Bronze, a foundry in Vancouver. The work was installed on August 20, 1936.The bronze figure standing atop the granite plinth is said to bear little physical resemblance to Captain George. The sculpture was copied from a maquette, which had been fashioned after a painting that was in turn, a copy from an original painting.\r\nAn interesting conversation is recorded between Major Matthews, the City Archivist, and Townley. \r\nMatthews: \"Mr. Townley, the \"Sun\" newspaper wants to know how much the Vancouver statue cost and who paid for it.\"\r\nTownley: \"What do they want to bring that up for? Leave sleeping dogs lie. I've been afraid that matter would come up, but it has not...why bring it up now? It was all in the contract; everything was above board; there's nothing to hide; but if it gets out what it cost, then some fool will start writing to the newspapers, or something, and complain of the waste of money; say it ought to have been given towards the support of some fool scheme of his own, the \"home for incurable dogs\", or some other idiotic thing\".\r\nMatthews: \"Alright; drop it, I don't want to know; the \"Sun\" is publishing a story on the statue, and I suppose they want to put the cost in.\"\r\nTownley: \"Well, Charles Marega made it, and baby bonds paid for it...I don't know exactly what it cost; it would be hard to find out; part of it was in the stone work cost. Marega for $5000, and then there was the base; so much per square foot for the base, perhaps $500 for that...\"\r\nThe statue was cleaned in 2001, 65 years after its installation and in time for the city's 115th birthday. The bill for cost of cleaning was $5800, almost the same amount as the original statue cost. This sculpture is on the City of Vancouver's Heritage Inventory list and, as a proud homage to a great explorer, has stood the test of time.",

These timbers are set on end in a seemingly random pattern on six concrete pads in the middle of Granville Square and mostly enclosed within a 50 foot diameter circle of red tiles. The sculpture measures about 40 feet by 60 feet and is roughly in the shape of a cross.  Known as \"Phifer's Fountain\", this work was commissioned in 1973 by the CPR and Marathon Realty to address a plaza of which the zoning panel of the day said \"a truly `civic square', as the developers propose, should be more generous and festive in concept.\" (Rezoning application, October 1968) This plaza was described in the 1969 development permit application as \"developed with trees, sitting area, fountain, grass mounds, architectural lighting, etc.\" Somewhere along the line, the \"fountain\" turned into a 30 foot by 60 foot sculpture.\r\n\"The CPR went to Washington State to find someone to design these columns of squared timber to represent, in abstract form, BC forests. The wood used would supply enough timber to build 10 homes.\" (A Guide to Sculpture in Vancouver, Peggy Imredy, 1980)\r\nBy 2002, some of these columns had deteriorated substantially and Marathon wanted to redevelop the plaza. Some effort was made to find a new home for this quintessential 70s work, with the artist choosing to give it to the interior community of Princeton, where it currently stands as the gateway to the Trans Canada Trail. http://town.princeton.bc.ca/newpages/parksandrec/phifersfount.html#",

The extension of the pavement above the water’s edge is meant to suggest this disappearance underground, to stir memory and history, while at the same time reinforcing the sense of the above ground space as a visually continuous promenade and plaza.\r\n\r\nThe pond’s dominant feature, a circular granite sculpture sited in the center of the pond, is elevated above the grade of the paving so that a viewer (pedestrian or resident) can fully comprehend its form: a form that might suggest a flower, a wheel, a saw blade....This sculpture also has a spatial function to gather and hold energy as well as operating as a source of water for the pond. The three granite rings embedded in the concrete plaza reiterate the central well of the sculpture from which the water flows and activate the plaza plane. This plane is further activated by the stainless steel rings that echo both the shape of the pond ends as well as the wave movement of the water.\r\n\r\nAs the pedestrian moves into the space the sound of the falling water becomes more dominant till the extraneous sounds of the street are entirely absorbed offering respite and perhaps an opportunity for further engagement and reflection.",

            "description": "A life size bronze statue of a woman in a wetsuit, with flippers on her feet and her mask pushed up on her forehead, sits on a large intertidal boulder just offshore of Stanley Park. In September of 1968, Douglas Brown, a Vancouver lawyer, talked to sculptor Elek Imredy about his desire to commission a sculpture inspired by the famous Copenhagen mermaid, which could be sited on the great granite boulder just off the northern shore of Stanley Park. Imredy proposed a life-size bronze sculpture of a scuba diver. On Brown&#39;s initiative, the Vancouver Harbour Improvement Society was formed with the intention of financing and facilitating a unique landmark for both Vancouverites and visitors to the city. They raised the money to produce the sculpture privately and Imredy was commissioned to craft the proposed work. The Vancouver Park Board gave permission to the society to place the sculpture on the rock. Because the boulder was often covered at high tide, a precast concrete ring was created and the rock was lifted by a floating crane and set on the ring about 100 feet from its original location. Imredy first took a mold of the top surface of the rock. In his studio, he made a replica of the rock and modeled the figure in clay. Imredy asked his young friend Debra Harrington to model, however the sculpture is not recognizably her image. &quot;When I couldn&#39;t get the model to hold her hand the way I wanted it... I held my left hand in front of a mirror, showing its opposite, and I modeled right one. Of course, I made it a bit nicer, with longer fingers.&quot; A plaster of paris mold was made from the clay figure and the sculpture was cast in fibreglass. This fibreglass figure was flown to Rome where it was cast in bronze at Giovanni and Angelo Nicci&#39;s foundry. On June 9th, 1972, the sculpture was set in place by an electric crane reaching out from shore to the rock 80 feet away and fastened to the stone with stainless steel bolts. The next day the sculpture was ceremoniously unveiled. &quot;Girl in Wetsuit&quot; has become a landmark for visitors to Stanley Park and to boats that enter the harbour.",

                "artists_description": "In the fall of 1909 a committee was formed to build a memorial to David Oppenheimer, former Mayor of Vancouver. Oppenheimer was an entrepreneur from Germany and served four 1-year terms as Mayor. He donated land for city parks and for the Rogers sugar refinery. The memorial committee planned to hire Augustus St. Gaudens to build a memorial gate to connect Stanley Park to the City in honour of Oppenheimer but they found out St. Gaudens was dead.  Charles Marega was new to Vancouver and had his first exhibition here with the Studio Club in October of 1909, showing small wax figures. Art critic Felix Penne (Francis Bursill) wrote in Vancouver World, \"These have the right feeling and directness of life and there is every indication the sculptor is capable of broader and more ambitious work - which I shall be glad to see.  Soon Vancouver will not have to propose dead sculptors to design memorials - there are and will be living and capable sculptors nearer home than on the other bank of the Styx..\" The original budget for the project was $50,000, but by the time Marega was commissioned in 1910, the project had become a bust for $4500, of which Marega was paid $3600 and the balance paid for an elaborate unveiling ceremony.

The design was originally created in 1936 for the Sheet Metal Workers Local 280 float for the Pacific National Exhibition Jubilee Parade on the occasion of the City of Vancouver's 50th birthday. It was designed by Lew Parry and made into a sculpture, built by Neon Products, which was sited at the first Vancouver Air Terminal from 1939 to 1972 when it was scrapped because of rust. In 1985 the Vancouver Transportation Club and the Sheet Metal Workers Union 280 decided to build a replica to celebrate Vancouver's 100th birthday. They located Lew Parry and he still had the original plans. This time the rocketship was built from more durable materials by Terminal Sheet Metal and the Local 280 metal workers. The Rocket was exhibited at Expo 86 and then donated to the city. It was moved by helicopter to it's current site. A Centennial Time Capsule is housed in the base of the rocket, scheduled to be opened 50 years from 1986. It includes items such as an Expo 86 passport with stamps of all the pavilions and recorded messages from local celebrities and many other things.\r\nThe City accepted the Centennial Rocket and a site was found for it in the small plaza at the SW end of the Cambie Street bridge.  -information from the website of SMW280",

Two bronze medallions inset into each ball; one end depicts a star and the other is the face of a person in action. All balls are 60.5&quot; in diameter.\r\n\r\nThis artwork was officially deaccessioned November 2020. After an extensive redevelopment of the area surrounding Rogers Arena, resituating the artwork became unfeasible within the revised ground plan. As well, the artist had requested that The Game not be re-installed, stating that it was created for a time and place that no longer exist, and that the work is not relevant for other contexts.\r\n\r\nThe City of Vancouver strives to acquire and commission works of art of the highest quality. Acquisition by the City implies a commitment to the preservation, protection and maintenance of artwork for the public benefit and implies permanency within the collection. As such, deaccessioning is a serious consideration requiring careful planning and adherence to the conditions set out in our Deaccession Policy.\r\n\r\nhttps://vancouver.ca/files/cov/PublicArt-DeaccessionGuidelines.pdf",

There are two teams of balls - 7 for each side.  It appears as a game in progress…  Contributing to the idea that there are dramatic consequences to this game, bronze medallions are set into each ball to carry the image of a person in action.  In the form of a portrait,  these human images lend an identity to each ball and also indicate its situation in the game.  Some faces appear triumphant, others suffer the stress of falling or spinning... At the opposite pole each ball carries the image of a star.  Whether read as rising or falling this sign casts the player as a guest of fate, inexorably rolled along in the flow of events.  (the artist)",

This is not a fountain of youth but of time, old time reborn in the ever flowing spring of records of human endeavour.\r\nWith the advent of the millenium at hand, reflections on the passing of time increase. The numbers observable in Fountain of Time (five, six, seven) reflect a countdown to the millenium: '95, '96 '97. In this context the fountain is a portrait of a certain reality of our time. Yet this particular reality (that of the twentieth century drawing to a close, and what that brings to mind), is only one of many many realities, relevent to those following the Gregorian calendar rather than for example the Islamic, Tibetan or Mayan calendars. This notion of \"mutable reality\" is a familiar theme in my work, which seeks to explore the boundaries of realism and representation:  Time... History... Motion... Imagination... Reflection…",

Supported by development funds from the Bentall Corporation and the generous assistance of Mr. Douglas B. Forster.\r\n\r\nThis work was officially deaccessioned August 2021. After repeated and significant attempts to restore this work over many years, it became clear that no amount of repair work could return functionality and it was detrmined that full removal was the last remaining option available.\r\n\r\nThe City of Vancouver strives to acquire and commission works of art of the highest quality. Acquisition by the City implies a commitment to the preservation, protection and maintenance of artwork for the public benefit and implies permanency within the collection. As such, deaccessioning is a serious consideration requiring careful planning and adherence to the conditions set out in our Deaccession Policy.\r\n\r\nhttps://vancouver.ca/files/cov/PublicArt-DeaccessionGuidelines.pdf",

The concept is based upon the mythical river Lethe, the river as a repository of memories.\r\nOnce, only a stone's throw from this site, an ancient stream flowed down through a forest. It carried into the \"well\" of the sea the memories from earliest times. \r\nI am proposing a symbolic reclamation of the past and recognition of change. ... there will be three elements within this flowing river. From the \"source\" at the upper waters a 10 ton erratic glacial boulder will be positioned ... at the pool below will be its mirror image, in bronze altered by chemical reaction and time. Language is the third bridging element, for words to convey a sense of a river's journey I have used the following quote by Leonardo da Vinci: \"In rivers, the water you touch is the last of what has passed, and the first of that which comes; so with time present.\"",

            "description": "Integrated into the public walkway through the Lions Developement at 1300 West Georgia, is a plaza incorporating fibre optic lights, mosaic swirls, and 3 large bronze castings of cargo ships seen from above. The lights, which are at grade level, define constellations in the night sky. The colorful swirls represent other galaxies and deep space objects, and the boats allude both to the actual cargo ships found in Vancouver's harbour and to mankind's use of the stars as navigation tools.     \r\nKerr's sculpture was commissioned by the developer of the site after a competition sanctioned by the Vancouver Public Art Committee. It has been integrated into the public plaza/walkway that runs diagonally through the site from the corner of Alberni and Broughton to the corner of Jervis and Georgia.\r\nThe work addresses pedestrian traffic through the walkway both during the day and as a completely different experience at night. It also allows opportunities for viewing the work from above from suites in the towers and from neighbouring towers.\r\n\"Milky Way\" has four elements layered into the work. The first is 39 colorful mosaic spiral galaxies scattered across the site. The brilliantly colorful mosaic tiles stand in marked contrast to the second element, colored stone aggregate which has been laid down in large abstract fiels and which represent the \"cosmic sea\". The third element is 170 fibre optic point lights, in four different intensities, which represent the stars in 36 constellations. These \"stars\" are each set into a black granite star shaped tile and each constellation is further defined by lines of polished brass set into the aggregate. The last element is three large bronze castings of cargo ships, commonly seen in Vancouver's harbour - a fishing trawler, a tug and gravel barge, and a BC ferry - all seen from above.\r\nThis work is both public and private, it welcomes both day and night viewing (in some sense providing its own light), and it enhances both public space and the developer's concerns for place making and site harmony. \"Milky Way\" is a successful example of Vancouver's public art program which has emphasized \"site specific\" public art instead of traditional sculpture.",

We walk like giants through a carpet of lights, our footsteps stir the universe.\" (From artists' proposal)\r\n\r\n\"…There are four main elements layered into the work. First, 40 tile mosaics spiral across the site in 16 brilliant colours. Each design has been abstracted from photo images of actual galaxies. Then clusters of stars are created by 160 fibre optic points of light set in granite tiles which in turn are joined by polished brass dashed lines to define familiar constellations. The granite has been designed and laid out in four shapes reflecting four different starlight intensities. Third, alluding to humankind's historical fascination with navigation of the heavens, four large bronze castings of ships, icons familiar to Vancouver's harbours, are set at each port or threshold of entry - a fishing trawler, a gravel barge and tug, and an 18-foot long ferry. Finally, the 40 colour fields of stone aggregate, which overlay and unite all the elements, are abstractions of colour maps made of the Milky Ways' \"cosmic sea.\" The recurring fours and forties and their multiples in the work refer to wholeness, totality, and completion (appropriate for a work completed at the end of the millennium).\" (From news release for public opening ceremony)",

Each painting acquires through its intrinsic translucency a depth and vibrancy that allows the images to float.

Particularly, this work examines the upbringing of a child, not just the child as product of upbringing but, in terms of his or her relationship to others and the moments that influence the child. It is not only the child who is examined but the viewer, too, is drawn into the work and provoked to reflect on their own childhood.\r\n\r\nThe image that comprises the left half of the installation...undermines the idea that children are insulated or exempt from adult feelings of suffering. The boy is vulnerable, intimidated, and sad [and the] tone is harsh, negative, and angry, obviously detrimental to the boy&rsquo;s self-worth.\r\n\r\nThe right-hand image text supports the idea that it is a mother who is speaking affectionately to her daughter. At some level, this may translate into pressure that is put on the child to succeed. Issues of race and culture are interwoven with concepts of child-rearing.\r\n\r\nLum&rsquo;s A Tale of Two Children, through the two scenes, illustrates two different points on a large spectrum of parenting. Race, is one factor among many that influences child-rearing. Socio-economic and cultural backgrounds effect the relationship between parent and child as well. Lum conveys the multiplicity of parenting. The work is personal, local, and intimate while at the same time anonymous, global, and public. The complexity of the artwork mirrors the intricate multiplicity of childhood itself.",

Both figures wear Salish blankets incorporating weaving designs and a salmon motif. On the reverse side, the male has traditional design elements and the female has a motif influenced by Salish berry basket designs.                                                                                            2) Grandparents and Grandchildren Honoured - On the upright poles located southwest of the path an intertwined braid of hair links the three female faces of the grandparents pole, illustrating the powerful matrilineal ancestry of the Coast Salish. The abstract design on the back represents the salmon, once so plentiful in the area. The grandchildren pole pays tribute to the importance of the family bond.

A Coast Salish Dancer shows a human figure holding a sea serpent rattle and above it, the Thunderbird, the most powerful of all spirits and a symbol of protection. On the opposite face of the Dancer, tree roots connect us to the land, sea and sky.

            "description": "Double Blind is a large-scale sculptural installation by Antonia Hirsch, commissioned for the atrium of the new Vancouver Community College’s Broadway Campus Phase One Expansion building. Spanning four stories of the building, Double Blind  translates a Snellen, or eye, chart into Braille by using dome mirrors in order to emulate the raised dots of Braille script.\r\n\r\nDome mirrors are endemic to public spaces and can be found in pedestrian underpasses, hospital corridors, and in commercial retail contexts. They are used for surveillance as well as for the prevention of collisions in pedestrian traffic flow. Public space is often highly contested since it must typically answer to the idealist demands of communal space while also satisfying the concerns for public safety that are frequently associated with control and surveillance. Like many atriums, the new Vancouver Community College’s interior public space has a panoptic tendency: emphasizing ‘insight’ into various interior spaces from specific vantage points. This panoptic tendency is echoed in the domed mirrors, each reflecting a 360° view of the surrounding space.\r\n\r\nDouble Blind deliberately and emphatically utilizes elements that are commonly found in public space and re-purposes them, thereby highlighting the quality of the space itself, rather than offering a pictorial escape from its reality. Double Blind queries the interlinked ideas of seeing and controlling, acknowledging the importance of the context in which information is acquired and processed, whether that context is a scientific doctrine, social matrix, or language system.\r\n\r\nThis sculptural work is accompanied by a T-shirt multiple that echoes the installation’s oxymoronic premise: those who can see the work likely don’t read braille, and those who read braille can probably not see the work.\r\n\r\nOn the back of each T-shirt, an eye chart is rendered in raised letters. Though reproduced in a colour identical to that of the shirt and thereby nearly invisible, the characters are tangible. Conversely, the front of each shirt mirrors the installation’s graphic arrangement in reflective foil, yet these braille dots are entirely two-dimensional, visible, but not available through touch.",

The slender, elongated sculpture balances as if a huge raindrop were on the verge of landing on the sea walk.\r\n\r\nAlthough the sculpture takes a natural phenomenon as its starting point, it displays a technical perfection, artificially coloured to correspond to the sky and contrasting with the pale yellow mass of the mountain of sulphur visible on the horizon, waiting to be loaded into cargo ships.\r\n\r\nThe sculpture’s angle and orientation create a visual dialogue with the architecture of the Convention Centre West, as well as with the bows of the gigantic cruise ships frequently docked nearby.  Like an abstract, radiant-blue ship’s figurehead, it marks the interface between land and water, between nature and technology.",

                "artists_description": "THE WORDS DON&rsquo;T FIT THE PICTURE [was] a text-based work made in response to the context, building and public surrounds of the Vancouver Public Library. The work takes the form of a large freestanding sign that sits in front of the VPL just off the southern entrance of the building in a heavy pedestrian traffic area. The sign takes its cues from an era of signage when signs were once seen as celebratory, grand and iconic &ndash; in effect, as landmarks in their own right as a kind of symbolic architecture (think: Caesars Palace, The Flamingo, The Stardust &ndash; to the landmark of all landmarks, Hollywood). In tracing this lineage, the work also acknowledges a local history when Vancouver was once seen as one of the neon-light capitals of North America. Reminders of this once past persists in signs like BOW-MAC &ldquo;on Broadway&rdquo; (now retro-fitted with the Toys R&rsquo; Us sign) and of course the W atop of what once was the Woodward&rsquo;s building. In adopting the form of a sign, THE WORDS DON&rsquo;T FIT THE PICTURE elides the classifications of traditional sculpture, by evoking a typology that is at once familiar and accessible. Taken within the context of a public library, the work touches upon &ndash; in a very poetic way &ndash; the use of words and language as boundless and imaginative, as a catalyst for a multiplicity of meanings.",

My pieces are not about that what we see, not about that what appears in front of our eyes but about that what is behind them, about that what presupposes seeing. My pieces in the urban environment, in a building or in the outer space do not exist without contact to their surroundings. They exist in a social and local context. This context is defined by the architectural surrounding, the architectural idea and the social situation: the co-operation of different historic, functional, organizational, visual, acoustic, tactile, communicative moments.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of perception, orientation, movement and communication determine my thoughts about the situation and the development of an idea for the special place. So, my pieces refer to the place and the context, explore existing rooms, architecture, places, situations with different medias and react to the specific parameters of the surroundings:  the place—the situation—the function. On the other hand everyday moments and social connections play a role. I am interested in the specific site that the work exists in. My intention has been to change the nature of the public space. This space altered by my input, becomes the art. \r\n\r\nLight is my most preferred media I deal with because of its special quality. Light is a basic element. Without light there is no life. Besides, light is a very changeable element: Actually light—daylight and artificial light—exists in endlessly different versions. And light is a very ephemeral element; that's why I like it. I am very interested in all these special qualities.",

                "artists_description": "Passage is one of a series of cultural projects that was on view through the months of February and March along the Carrall Street Greenway in the Downtown Eastside. Yero&rsquo;s project was visible from the street during the day through the window of Access Gallery. Peering through a revealed slot in the otherwise darkened window the viewer will experience intense flashes of light, created by flickering LED lights which momentarily highlight knife blades set against a black backdrop in a completely darkened room. The brief beams of light on the spikes of metal suggest the reflection of light created from a lighthouse beacon, announcing a vast dark sea. Engaging the individual senses, yet disorientating the viewer and evoking the feeling of being alone in the middle of a dark ocean at night, the work offered a sense of solitude within the public space of the street. Its contrasting beauty and brutality also incited inevitable reflections about violence and self-preservation in the marginalized neighbourhood in which the work is situated. As an immigrant to Canada from Cuba, Yero has consistently been concerned with themes that relate to his experience as part of the growing Cuban diaspora. Since living in Canada, Yero still frequently visits his homeland, where many of his family and friends continue to live with limited possibilities to leave. Like the paradoxical freedom and panic that swimming in a wide dark ocean may induce, Cubans are legally bound to their country, which is both home and prison. Many who try to escape across the ocean do not survive, or arrive on the other side only to be returned. The metaphor of death prevails in Yero&rsquo;s practice. The title of the work, Passage, reflects these ideas &ndash; water is evoked as the dual possibility of freedom and death. This work also addresses myriad issues of integration and dislocation facing immigrants to a new country. Exhibited during a global event promoting nationalistic pride through marketing terms such as &ldquo;dream,&rdquo; &ldquo;discover,&rdquo; and &ldquo;celebrate,&rdquo; the installation in turn speaks to the underlying complexities of these utopic ideals.",

There are two components: a large-scale projection in public space, and an interior projection within the gallery fed by a live surveillance camera. By using participants’ video clips documenting the Vancouver 2010 Olympic, Paralympic and related events, viewers are asked to consider the ways in which the International Olympic Committee and the City of Vancouver is represented officially, and the alternative views that are largely dismissed, or written over, by the spectacle machine, which serves to homogenize the Canadian subjectivity. Issues explored are surveillance versus sousveillance, the ways in which we watch events, the ways in which we watch each other and the ways in which we are being watched.\r\n\r\nParticipation consisted simply of video documenting the Olympic, Paralympic and Torch Relay events with cell phones (or any other video capturing device) and the clips were submitted by email and larger files were uploaded to an ftp site. The files were automatically pulled from the inbox and inserted into the video line-up at fifteen minute intervals. These clips were then projected onto the Gallery building, in a gated and locked courtyard, mimicing the inaccessibility of the Olympics. The people could gather on the sidewalk to watch the projection, and that area was monitored by the surveillance camera, which was projected on the wall in the gallery by a live. The gallery audience was essentially watching the audience outside watching the projection of the audience watching the Olympics. \r\n\r\nThere is a two-part archival book project that accompanies the work and is available online at www.liddlethought.blogspot.com. The first part includes contextual texts by Kristina Lee Podesva and Danna Vajda  and images of the Torch Relay. The second part of the book will be available in April. It will function as an archive of the event as it unfolds over the time of the Olympic and Paralympic games. This book project will not only document the work, it will also function as a vehicle for the dissemination of the representations collected that provide an alternate view of the “official” versions sanctioned and circulated by VANOC and the City of Vancouver. Multiple subjectivities will add complexity to this overarching image of Vancouver. \r\n\r\nRina Liddle is a visual artist, researcher and educator. At the core of her practice is the belief that art making is a polyvocal practice. Her work often takes the form of installations and interventions that deal with ideas regarding public space, and include digital media, photography, sculptural elements and collaborations. The material forms that she chooses are, for her, a means to renegotiate and make visible the conditions of the social body. Or something like that. Do you know what I mean? Subtle traces of the absurd in sociological methodologies are discernable in her work.",

On one level, the works refer to modern painting and studies in abstraction.

This second trolley also featured three thematically related interior cards in which knit figures act as the dramatis personae.\r\n\"Memento – Multo\", inside a third trolley, featured a set of twenty-two interior cards depicting over 100 different examples of the modest but culturally and aesthetically interesting objects that can be found in shops along Main’s 88 Blocks.",

Main Street is more typically characterized by the presence of a multitude of objects that tend to have a personal meaning and relate to everyday life rather than high-end consumption. The poodle was chosen as a motif for the sculpture and other artworks in Memento because it is expressive of the general surroundings of the street. The poodle is not associated with a particular culture, and can therefore be enjoyed by a wide range of people along the street and in the surrounding neighbourhoods. Untitled (Poodle) is intended as a curiosity that will bring attention to the sculpture as a marker or icon of time and place. The sculpture is based on and is a representation not of a living poodle, but rather of a porcelain figurine, the kind of object that might be found in any number of shops along Main Street.",

The convergence of these groups is protrayed in a woven design with symbols, narratives and text from each culture. The mural was conceived with input from each of the three communities, and incorporated into the final design. The mural includes many unifying elements including a large wave suggesting constancy, adaptability, humans' relationship to nature and connectivity to roots and language.

Indians of the Coast Salish Squamish arrived in their dugout canoes to rescue people, sheltering them in their nearby village church. The poem that was sung as they paddled the inlet is inscribed on the bow of the canoe. The movement of the paddles is echoed in vertical bamboo along the left side, superimposed with the Hanji character meaning 'Harmony\" and aims to emphasize the collaborative nature of this project as well as the unique characteristic of the Downtown Eastside where several cultures co-exist in harmony.",

                "artists_description": "Substation Pavilion consists of a small structure constructed of board-formed Ductal concrete, steel and glass, with a door that hints at a possible entrance (although in this case it is merely a\r\ndecoy). There are windows on two sides, adding to the illusion of some kind of use value implicit to its presence on the site. The windows are utilitarian, institutional, industrial, with frosted security glass containing wire that obscure a direct line of site into the structure. Within the pavilion is a single, dim light. The pavilion sits immediately to the east of the entrance to the Meccanica development on the corner of First Avenue and Quebec Street in Vancouver, BC. The design borrows from the artdeco influenced electrical substations that are interwoven in Vancouver’s urban fabric. The piece looks as if it has been a long-term tenant of the site, as if it belongs to the area and is a relic of an earlier age. The illusion of its permanence is ruptured by a number of elements that disturb a simple and seamless inclusion in the local vernacular. The pavilion’s design references utility and yet as a consequence of the breaking up of vertical relations within the piece it becomes obvious\r\nsomething else is going on. What possible use could be made of a structure that seems to have no level floor, let alone barely enough room to turn around in? Why would so much attention be paid to the design of such a small and inconsequential piece of infrastructure?\r\nSubstation Pavilion’s design hints at the networks of subterranean connections with the rest of the city and with the past of the site itself. The entire area of False Creek consisted of a marshy wetland prior to its infill. This program of ‘reclaiming’ the tidal areas of Vancouver allowed for the development of the rail yards and industrial infrastructure at the east end of False Creek. This established a horizontal approach to looking at and moving through the growing city, tied as it was to these rail lines. The vertical tendencies of this project aim to introduce the rupturing of the quotidian relationship with the horizontal that dominates movement through the city. The strata formed in the soil of the False Creek area carry the history of the settlement of the area. The networks of the rail yards spread the stories of the people passing through them,\r\ncreating layers within the cultural memory of the city. Over the years this cultural detritus molds and rots just as the soil and the structures of the area do. Together they form a humus that\r\ncontains the mold that supports life in the city, spreading underneath every structure we build and every story we tell. This is a fertile substrate, not one given to decay and destruction. It supports connections and unexpected developments, much as the rhizomorphic systems of a large fungus will remain hidden, spreading underground and only exhibiting its presence once a\r\nyear with its short-lived mushroom heads. It is a constantly shifting and ever-present narrative running just below the surface of the city.\r\nCedric Bomford\r\nOctober, 2014",

When these colours do occur, they seem almost jarring - too powerful and unresponsive to changes in light and weather. \"Dichroic Vancouver\" introduces a set of colour-changing bands of glass to the new Manulife Financial office building. Four delicate lines of dichroic glass are integrated into the southeast and southwest facades to bring nuances of shifting colour to viewers. The hues are affected by climatic and light modulations in the sky. Like weather and emotion, all is in a constant state of change. Viewers witness surprising and changing conditions of light and colour; a welcome addition to a sometimes monochromatic city. \"Colour is a power which directly influences the soul.\" - Wassily Kandisky, Concerning the Spiritual in Art",

The artwork, Refined, draws\r\nspecifically on the forms and processes of salt purification\r\nwhich used to take place in the building immediately\r\nproximal to the site while exploring the overall\r\ntransformation of the neighbourhood itself.\r\nThe artwork is composed of five pure-white, conical\r\nsculptures of varying heights that sit within a recessed pool\r\nof recycled glass. During the day, the pure geometric forms\r\nand angular shapes of the surrounding glass elements\r\ncatch and play with natural sunlight. At night, warm hued\r\nlights, evocative of the colour of salt in its raw unrefined\r\nstate, cast a glow onto the artwork surfaces.",

Though their form is sculptural, the lanterns' state of partial collapse evokes an air of incompleteness in deep contrast to their urban environment. They are not resolved in the way architecture requires, but instead hover with a sense of openness. Scaled up and clustered in colourful constellations, their pressence will heighten the dramatic possibilities of the site while making and activating the space below them. The lanterns follow a geometric design with their component shape being found as the \"leaf\" in the 1925 abstract trees of French sculptors Jan and Joel Martel.",

Drawing on broad references of horizon lines and landscape art, Lee enables passers-by to visualize the wind.Building on a sense of theatricality, Lee’s installation acts as an elaborate set composed of three-dimensional objects that cast larger-than-life shadows againstan enormous backdrop. Red, Green and Blue draws viewers into the intersections of artifice and nature with an abundant field of transparent cones fabricated from sheets of hand-folded plastic film. It is both painting and sculpture, using light filtered hrough red, green and blue lighting gels to project an immersive field of coloured, grass-like forms on the architecture of Offsite.Although an oasis literally refers to the greenery within a desert, it also describes a peaceful location or imagined place where one might escape the rigours of everyday life. Lee’s oasis unfolds into an array of colourful and contemplative possibilities that break up the monotony of grey surroundings.",

When a home is demolished, those repositories of lived experiences are destroyed. We may have mementos in the form of photographs of the space, maybe a home video, but the physical materials imbued with histories of deep, personal, human interactions disappear. When a physical vessel for memories is demolished, it weakens the memory itself – so how well do our memories survive as we are continually displaced, and our homes are eventually dismantled?In Picture window the artist’s hand is the hand of a labourer. The geometric pattern painted throughout this image is a found pattern from the home’s kitchen, where the stripe was painted on a cinderblock wall. It has been carefully carried throughout the home, touching every room, before going out the bedroom window. This line is transformed into a representation of the gaze of someone living in this house. It is positioned at head height and follows a line of view through the home, pausing where a piece of art once hung, then continuing out the window.At the same time, it is the line of gaze from outside the home into a bedroom. From embodiment to inhabiting, the life of a home is both an extension of the body and a microcosm of society at large. Who lived here in the past? What was their life like? Who will get to live here in the future, in the new home constructed on this site? Who designed and built these homes? Who cleaned and maintained them? What is lost with the demolition of the old home? What is gained by the building of the new home? Who suffers from rising house costs and who gains?",

I work with painting as a process of thought. I believe that the physicality of the work and its indexicality of painted marks and gestures (subtle touches, rough scumbles, offhanded smears and studied glazes, etc.) vicariously open this exploratory thinking to an audience.\r\n\r\nI am interested in the physiology of perception and how it is personally and culturally codified. My work considers how the world is realized through pictures: that how we picture the world (and how we are taught to picture the world) is how the world becomes. And I consider that if the resolution of a painting-object can be delayed and the process of perception is held open, a maker/viewer may discover agency there. For me the experience of making and looking at the painted object are intimately aligned with the scenes and experiences that I represent. This is a productive alignment. I confuse and equate the space of painting with the space of the world.\r\n\r\nARTWORK STATEMENT\r\n\r\nThe painted image for this work is a view through trees (on the border of urban and &lsquo;natural&rsquo; spaces) of Burrard Inlet at the start of səli̓ lw̓ ət (Indian Arm). It is seen from an imaginary vantage point: a view that doesn&rsquo;t exist. It is either dusk or dawn and so is unfixed in time as well as place.\r\n\r\nThis work is intended to provide space for reflection, outside of work and daily tasks: an interstitial moment to get lost in. The painting is dramatically enlarged and backlit. Its installation on the building&rsquo;s soffit is parallel to the ground. The final scale, glow and placement add to a sense of disorientation, offering an hallucinatory respite from the everyday.",

In a way, they indicate that shared systems such as housing soon become personal spaces, which reflect the lives that inhabit them.\r\n\r\nCharms was commissioned by Imani Development as part of their participation in the City of Vancouver&#39;s Public Art Program for Private Development.",

Now often received as heirlooms, charm bracelets, unlike other forms of property, tend to be passed matrilineally over generations. As they are passed from an older set of hands to a younger one, with it are the rare personal histories embedded in each item. They are tokens of important moments and memories. Whether it is celebration, heartache, or a point of discovery, we carry these histories close on our bodies. Charms, as a proposal, repeats the gesture, holding close to the body of the building.",

The public art is part of the City’s ongoing commitment to reconciliation and strengthening of relations between Indigenous communities and Vancouverites.The murals, banners and transparencies were commissioned as part of the City of Vancouver's commemoration of the sesquicentennial of Canada's confederation. Vancouver refocused the national celebration on its indigenous peoples and First Nations, who long precede confederation, and whose resurgence will continue long past the anniversary--hence \"150+\".The public art program issued a call for murals in January 2017. The six successful applicant teams were reviewed and chosen by a selection panel of Indigenous artists and art professionals.The projects were realized throughout the city centre, including projects at the central library, Queen Elizabeth Theatre and its plaza, the headhouse of a Canada Line station, a laneway on the Downtown Eastside, and the lot where the Kanata Fest and the Drum Is Calling Festival were held.Works variously drew from Coast Salish, formline, and Woodland School forms, presented portraits mixing contemporary and traditional clothing and regalia, and collaged photographic images into abstracted compositions.Commissioned in the spirit of Reconcilation, the project served to increase Indigenous visibility on the unceded territories of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations now known as Vancouver.",

The initial concept for the sign came from viewing large driftwood logs tossed up on rocks along the beach near the Vancouver Maritime Museum. The large horizontal cedar log was cut from a tree blown down by strong winds in Stanley Park, salvaged and donated by the City of Vancouver. The log has been set onto boulders excavated from the old Carling O'Keefe Brewery site at 12th Avenue and Arbutus, and donated by Intergulf Development Group.The vertical log sculpture is composed of 3 layers of upright logs stepping up and back from the viewer. The first carving on the front set of logs portrays a Coast Salish village with cedar plank houses and beached canoes, a scene which may have been typical around this area prior to European settlement.The carving on the second layer of logs portrays past and present roots of Kitsilano, including a traditional corner store, craftsman-style houses, adn Engine 374, which pulled the first transcontinental train into Vancouver in 1887, was retired to Kitsilano Park for many years, and is now on display in the Roundhouse Community Centre. Also portrayed on this layer is the Vancouver Museum and Pacific Space Centre.The third layer of carved logs portrays a view north across English Bay to Stanley Park, Vancouver's West End, and the North Shore mountains - a scene which is typical from almost any viewpoint in the Kitsilano area.The sign was designed by Kitsilano resident Jim Kostyniuk and carved by BC artist Pete Ryan. The sign is an initiative of the Kitsilano Chamber of Commerce. (Kitsilano Chamber of Commerce, Dedication of the Welcome to Kitsilano Sign and Sculpture, June 20, 1998)",

                "artists_description": "My vision for Fraser Commons was a pair of bronze sculptures. Mother and Child focuses on the idea of the family and is sited at the heart of the new development in the public park adjacent to the new daycare centre. This pair of sculptures hopes to foster through its biomorphic shapes, tactile material and series of openings, social and physical activity by encouraging children, teens and adults to interact with the work. The proposed work echoes the Fraser Commons&rsquo; ambition to create a family friendly and calm inviting space from which to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.\r\n\r\nOften regarded as the father of modern British sculpture, Henry Moore and his longtime friend, colleague and fellow sculptor Barbara Hepworth have been, time and again, a source of inspiration for my artistic work. In this instance, Mother and Child draws upon the artists&rsquo; use of abstraction of human and natural forms along with the recurring motif of the family. Like the work of Moore and Hepworth, the sculptures will be situated within the green space of the park and will act as a frame for the landscape.\r\n\r\nMother and Child is equally influenced by the post war &lsquo;play sculptures&rsquo; of British sculptor John Bridgeman (1916 &ndash; 2004) and Danish architect and sculptor Egon M&ouml;ller-Nielsen (1915 &ndash; 1959). Bridgeman and M&ouml;ller-Nielsen&rsquo;s play-sculpture hybrids are models for the work&rsquo;s sense of playfulness and will help to animate the space and humanize the architectural design of the new Fraser Commons.\r\n\r\nThe choice of traditional cast bronze is a nod to the works of these modernist masters, but is also motivated by my desire to encourage physical interaction, touching and movement through the works on the part of the viewer whose contact contributes to its changing patina. The sculpture&rsquo;s blue finish is informed by my childhood memories of the old Blue Boy Motel Hotel formerly located on the site. The colour provides something of an historical trace of the distinctive &lsquo;Wosk&rsquo; blue tiles which were a part of the Vancouver landscape for so long. The blue colour will also act as a beautiful counterpoint to the copper tones that are seen throughout Fraser Commons.\r\n\r\nMother and Child will invite interaction at the ground level of the community but will also have visual appeal when viewed from above. In its simplicity, the work will provide a focal point for the busy new hub of the Sunset community.",

Woven blankets, made from the wool of mountain goats and dog hair, were often worn as garments and used in ceremonies, but also made for use in the home.Today, very near the site of this installation, at the mouth of the Fraser River, Coast Salish blanket weaving continues in the community of Musqueam, where respected and accomplished weavers continue to develop this art form.Robyn Sparrow created two of these beautiful weavings (number 1 and 2 from the left, if facing the display case along Granville Street). Her weavings incorporate traditional weaving designs that reflect the Coast Salish (Musqueam) Culture, such as Salish V’s and Waves.Krista Point created two of these beautiful weavings (number 3 and 4 from the left, if facing the display case along Granville Street). The designs she used in these 2 weavings are flying geese, zigzag design (meaning is Lightening in the sky, trail from a snake).",

Meristematic cells give rise to various organs of a plant and are responsible for growth.The recent transformation of the Cambie corridor from single-family homes to higher density development inspired us to examine the idea of growth. The proximity of Queen Elizabeth Park focused this examination to expression of plant forms.The metaphor of undifferentiated cells allowing complex growth can be exended to the human and social spheres and to the opportunities presented by the dramatic change in the fabric of this neighbourhood.Two sides of the bronze sculpture are smooth planar sections terminating at the top in a point, while the third side is a rough, cast surface designed to retain an ancient-looking patina. The smooth surfaces present a calm and elegant facade to the viewer while the third side is seasoned with bright streaks of turquoise, purple and green sharing the warm brown surface.The viewer is able to engage in the two every different surfaces of the monolith in an intimage way due to scale.",

                "artists_description": "Deanna Bowen’s artistic practice concerns itself with histories of Black experience in Canada and the US. Her focus is the “dark matter” in our midst: people and events that remain just below the threshold of visibility, not because they are impossible to find but because they are difficult for the majority culture to acknowledge due to the systematized racism they expose. Mining overlooked archives, she asks difficult questions about who records history. She reactivates historic documents through a process of extraction, translation and enlargement, and then reinserts this material back into public consciousness in a new form. Over the past two years, Bowen has undertaken exhaustive research in Vancouver to trace a series of intertwined figures who formed an integral part of this city’s Black entertainment community from the 1940s to the end of the 1970s. She mapped a constellation of nightclubs, theatres and hotels where they gathered— many of which have been erased from the city’s physical fabric and its collective memory, but exist as traces in the archives. Her aim is to bring a more complex Black community into visibility, and to posit a powerful counterpoint to common narratives that oversimplify the city’s Black presence by containing it within the spatial, economic and temporal confines of Hogan’s Alley. Night Prowl captures part of a frame of filmed footage accompanying CBC reportage about Vancouver’s ethnically diverse east end nightclubs that aired on October 14, 1959. Racially-motivated anxieties around such nightclubs—and the neighbourhoods in which they were situated—would fuel the calls for urban renewal that would dramatically displace Black communities in the coming decades. The image, which depicts the neon marquee of a now-forgotten dance club after dark, is interrupted by a series of circular voids: visible fragments of batch numbers punched through the cellulose film at its time of manufacture. The holes are a banal artifact found at the end of any film reel. For Bowen, however, the ruptured cellulose reminds us of film’s fragile materiality, compromises its visual seamlessness and undermines our ability to trust photography’s seductive promise of “truth.” Considered this way, even blemished and seemingly insignificant documents can be rich repositories for unintended readings, and for questioning who has been charged with writing our histories, and why.Kimberly Phillips, Curator, Contemporary Gallery",

The passion for rebuilding, of bringing back to Vancouver what has been lost, is particularly moving. This tribute explores growth and rebirth - our youth rediscovering their roots and communing with their forebears through whatever means available.

More specifically, the chime sounds the two-note melody used by singer Mike Reno while singing the word &ldquo;weekend&rdquo; in the chorus that gives the song its title. The artwork explores themes of class, labour struggles and the versatility of pop music.\r\n\r\nAlthough the lyrics seem to loosely depict a kind of social-recreational interaction, the artist has interpreted the song as an unofficial sing-along anthem for the weekend itself and for working people. The artist Brady Cranfield says &ldquo;I see a parallel between the way everyday people use, reuse, remake and occupy that space and the way that we use, reuse, remake and occupy pop songs. Weekend Chime will hopefully act as a reminder that we&rsquo;re all workers, the true producers of value in the world.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nLearn more about this arwork here: Weekend Chime brochure (PDF)",

Specialized directional speakers are integrated into the ceiling panels, producing a highly controlled sound &ldquo;column&rdquo; that visitors walk into and out of at will. Customized paving on the ground plane visually identifies the location of the work.\r\n\r\nThe audio tracks are a series of collaborative texts/stories, gleaned from fourteen writers from around the city that, when taken together, weave narratives that define lives lived in proximity: restlessness and care. Each speaker reveals a randomized program of short narratives that span past, present and future: the work invites listeners to explore the ideas of Restless Futures (Speaker A), Speculative Pasts (Speaker B) and Instructions for Care in the present (Speaker C). Owing to programming by Remy Siu and responsive sound design by Antoine B&eacute;dard, each speaker retains a constantly shifting presence; each listener experiences a unique sequence of narrative and sound.\r\n\r\nThe narratives are drawn from emerging and established writers, including Lorna Brown, Lili Robinson, Amber Dawn, Aryo Khakpour, James Long, Maiko Yamamoto, Whess Harman, Amiel Gladstone, Jus-tine A. Chambers, Cease Wyss, Vanessa Kwan, Hiromi Goto, Faith Sparrow-Crawford, and Tim Carlson.\r\n\r\nThe use of sound relates to the artist team&rsquo;s interest in creating experiences in public space that draw attention to ideas, histories and subjectivities that lie beneath the surface of the city: quite literally the things we can&rsquo;t see. Each sound work is part of a greater narrative, each text building on a compo-sition that cannot be encompassed in one person&rsquo;s experience alone. The work is expected to evolve as a presence at the site over time, to stand as both a record of this place, in this moment&mdash;many of the narratives were written in 2020, in the midst of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in many ways reflect that unprecedented experience&mdash;while looking forward and back with speculation, anxiety and hope.",

                "artists_description": "The Dusk Meridian is a multimedia installation by the Vancouver&ndash; and Kelowna&ndash;based artist Keith Langergraber. Its principal features are scaled-down representations of two fire towers that are physically close but imaginatively separated: the real-life versions sit on either side of the border that divides Canada and the US at the southern boundary of E.C. Manning Provincial Park. The title refers to the moment in time between the setting of the sun and the onset of darkness and to the geographical location of this phenomenon, which endlessly traverses the rotating surface of the planet. It is also a nod to Cormac McCarthy&rsquo;s The Blood Meridian, an apocalyptic neo-biblical novel set in the border between the US and Mexico. These references are reiterated in the phantasmagoric light projected onto the fire towers, the pool of water on which they sit and the wall behind them, evoking a transitional condition somewhere between the setting of the sun and the approach of a catastrophic wildfire. But while the warmth of this light might contrast with the overcast gloom of a Vancouver winter, it offers little in the way of easy comfort.\r\n\r\nLangergraber&rsquo;s work serves as an allegory for crossing a point of no return: passing from light into darkness. Here, the devastation wrought by widespread wildfires&mdash;a force of nature unconstrained by abstractions like national borders&mdash;becomes the norm. The fire towers of The Dusk Meridian can be seen as silent witnesses to this transition, much like barometers measuring climactic change that has already arrived.\r\n\r\nThe Dusk Meridian featured a theatrical lighting component nightly from dusk until dawn.",

                "artists_description": "This artwork was exhibited at the City Centre Canada Line Station from October 3, 2022 - March 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nDuring the past two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, artist Janet Wang turned to books as a portal to society and far-flung notions of travelling or gathering with loved ones. When reading Alexandra Chang&rsquo;s &lsquo;Days of Distraction,&rsquo; she came across the word hiraeth, a Welsh word without a precise English translation that the author used to describe her own father&rsquo;s sense of longing for a bygone era or place. The word, with its complete unfamiliarity, unsettled the artist. Its soft, shapely sound, imprecision in translation and elegiac quality encapsulated the last few years.\r\n\r\nThis work, installed on the west-facing glass wall at the Canada Line City Centre Station asks, in Welsh and other languages, &ldquo;what will we be after we come through this time, where will we be when we take stock of all that has been far and is now near, and all that may return?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;To unlock a society, look at its untranslatable words&rdquo;\r\n- Salman Rushdie, Shame",

Mobility Device was one of five Untitled projects funded in 2020.\r\n\r\nMobility Device is a celebration of interdependence in the area of accessibility. In the special presentation that occured on September 17, 2021, the Carnival Band provided musical cues that indicated fixtures of the built environment (such as curbs, staircases and park benches) to inform non-visual artist Carmen Papalia&#39;s improvised route from Hadden Park Field House to Kitsilano Showboat Stage.\r\n\r\nCommissioned by Other Sights for Artists&#39; Projects with the support of the City of Vancouver&#39;s Untitled: Public Art Grants.\r\n\r\nAbout The Carnival Band\r\n\r\nA community driven musical project with origins dating back to 1997. The Carnival Band believes that community music is grounded in collaboration, with the aim of empowering the individuals involved. Songs and performances are a means to creative expression and community cohesiveness, rather than an end in themselves. All are welcome in The Carnival Band. \r\n\r\nAbout Other Sights for Artists&rsquo; Projects\r\n\r\nFounded in 2005 as a non-profit society, Other Sights for Artists&rsquo; Projects consider the aesthetic, economic and regulatory conditions of public places and public life. Operating as a Vancouver-based artist collective, Other Sights creates a presence for\r\nart in spaces and sites that are accessible to a broad public. Other Sights develops new and unexpected exhibition platforms and provides support to artists, writers and curators interested in creating temporary, critically rigorous work.",

It illustrates how a growing access ecology can cultivate new standards and practices that help maintain a caring culture where equity-seeking groups are not only supported in defining the terms around their participation but centered in their wholeness.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ndash; Carmen Papalia",

The piece was fabricated in Vanier Park during the summer of 1986 where visitors were invited to watch the construction process and interact with the artist.  The piece primarily consists of numerous parallel steel pipes intended to provide the sense of driving rain. Attached to many of these angled rain-like elements are shorter smaller pipes producing a simplified tree forms.   Interspersed among the pipe components are various objects associated with forestry; a crosscut saw, a baseball bat, a ladder, a house, all set at the identical angle to the tree branches.\r\nThe intention is to merge the visual sense of driving rain with trees and objects associated with forestry. Excessive repetition causes the piece to appear both chaotic and ordered.  Hopefully viewers can focus on any one of, or all of these elements simultaneously.",

When Terry lost his right leg to cancer in 1977 he decided to raise funds for cancer research. He would run across Canada and ask every Canadian to join the fight against cancer by donating one dollar. He began his Marathon of Hope in Newfoundland on April 12, 1980 heading for the Pacific and home 5,300 miles away. As he ran his daily 26 miles, the lone figure with the distinctive hop-and-skip gait became a symbol that captured the imagination of a nation.  On September 2, Terry was forced to abandon his run when cancer was discovered in his lung. That morning he had written 3,318 miles under the date in his diary. But the Marathon of Hope was not over. Messages of affection and encouragement flooded in and donations to continue the battle against cancer, eventually totaled more than $30 million. In the last year of his brief life Terry received many honours, but Terry Fox will always be remembered most as the young man who demonstrated and took a nation along with him on his Marathon of Hope. Dedicated 1984 by the people of British Columbia; Architect:Franklin Allen / The Corner Group; Illustration: Ian Bateson\"",

The steel containers in Refuse are actual refuse collectors: the concrete bases recall the idea of a plinth (with the steel wedge acting as a 'monument').  Collection functions as conduits for the 'preservation' of discarded and waste objects, parodying the idea of archaeology and historical recovery.\"  (page 79, Art and Design)",

The main focus of my practice, as a sculptor, has been to build kinetic assemblages which are in some way moved by the wind or  water.  The presence of a whimsical element is signature to my work and in part accounts for it’s popularity with children.      I often combine folk art sensibility and hi-tech mechanics to thematically  explore the relationships between society, technology, and the environment. I then relate this sculptural practice to the specific demands of public art.",

This entire process, six hours and fifteen minutes, was captured on HD video in one continuous take. The static shot is composed from the side with the plot at the bottom of the frame. The video ends when I have completely disappeared from the frame and have stopped shoveling. This work was initially exhibited as a scale video projection at the Or Gallery, Vancouver, in February 2007. Along with the video, a scale photograph of the empty gravesite, taken from directly above, was exhibited. The proportions of the excavation (the standard dimensions of a gravesite) happen to be the same as a ‘tombstone’ or artwork label, typically found in gallery or museum exhibitions (one aspect of my job at the Vancouver Art Gallery was to produce such labels). This grave cover thus lists the artist’s name, biographical information, title, media, and date of the work. After its installation at the cemetery, the stone was photographed from the same perspective as the original photograph of the excavation. This photograph will be included in future presentations of the project.",

In gesture, these drawings evoke a traditional type of mapping; exploring, discovering and defining a territory through a physical journey.”\r\n\r\nIn her work, Anna Ruth studies the meaning of boundary through the exploration of line. Her work is conceptual, minimalist and poetic. Line and two-dimensional texture are the base of her creation. She uses colour sparingly and an important part of the paper surface is always left untouched.  Reoccurring themes deal with territory, maps and other fabricated abstractions that are used to define space. Anna Ruth is interested in ideas that make us, as a society, feel secure, stable and powerful.",

This naturally occurring, perfectly level line – made evident by the saltwater rising to the level of the overhanging trees, makes a natural reveal, a feature seen and used in architecture to visually divide the floor from the wall.\r\n\r\nEn route from the north coast back to Vancouver, I developed the idea to create this large format photographic mural.  A reveal is typically the empty space at the bottom of a wall, where a measured gap is left so the floor and wall do not meet.  In this proposed photomural we will see how the saltwater rises twice a day, cutting an acutely accurate level in the tree boughs as they hang down from the forest landscape.  My interest was first drawn to this subtle occurrence when I realized the visual similarity to the architectural reveal, seen in homes, galleries and museums, a feature that is essential in the contextualizing and display of artwork.\r\n\r\nFor this mural I decided to repeat the same photo three times in order to draw attention to the architectural references of this work and remove it from the genre of pure photographic documentation.\r\n\r\nSituated within the public sphere this proposed photomural presents a very simple meeting of land and water, highlighting how we draw from different ecosystems, the ocean and the forest, to simultaneously sustain our city.  The allusion to the endless rise and fall of the tide will hopefully foster a connection to the changing of time and rethinking of urban space with an environmental sensitivity and an understanding of the shoreline that frames our city.",

For this reason, we collectively decided on a theme of migration, most specifically, the daily migration of crows. The mural suggests the almost mythic presence that crows hold for the population of Vancouver, a bird that has an iconic status in the city. As well, this theme reflects the daily human migration of commuters. \r\nArtistically, my challenge was to retain a poetic balance between representation and an underlying abstraction, giving the work an overall harmony and animation. In each of my mural projects, a focus is in the integration of the various elements.\r\n\r\nIn coming up with the motifs, we incorporated about 40 large stencils, generated from small relief prints created in community sessions. This allowed for many individuals to take part, including three mentored youth. Elements are then repeated in differing combinations throughout. Some of the local architecture, including McLean Drive General Store, are referenced, and a large head of a crow in an aboriginal design respects the territory of Native peoples where this wall is located. Artists worked to integrate the upper wall, with the garden area and in particular, with the lower wall, which is made up a series of images from stencils and freehand of insects, plants and seed forms that are indigenous to the area. \r\nIn all, forty-two people took part. The lower area of the mural was particularly well suited to youth participation, with some as young as three years old, and the oldest participant in his eighties. A set of videos were made of the process, as well as an extensive photo-documentation.",

The forms are influenced by the shape and contingencies of the stone itself during the carving process. Kerr's sculptures were commissioned by the Public Art Program through a selection process for artworks to celebrate the City's 125th anniversary. The granite and inlay sculpture, entitled Mind Crystal located on the corner of Hamilton and Georgia is a part of this series of works and is a permanent artwork.",

Seraphine was produced for the CBC Vancouver's Camera West series and was screened on September 17, 1969. The film tells the story of Seraphine Ned, journeying from the segregation of residential schools into a career in public nursing.",

                "artistprojectstatement": "Giants Among Us is my response to the role of reconciliation between Indigenous Peoples and Settlers to this land. Contained in the entire image are four separate scenes, which reflect narratives about monsters and giants based in oral history from the Central Coast. The themes to be taken away from these scenes are Protection, Escape, Rejection, and Balance.\r\n\r\nThe image at the top is titled Raven Meets the Cannibal and the theme of this scene is Protection. The Raven in this scene is both human and bird figure. The Raven is known up and down the coast as a trickster, creator and hero or helper of the people. The figure to the right is known as Baxbaxwalanuksiwe or the Cannibal of the North Door. He is known for keeping humans captive and consuming them. This spirit of consumption can affect humans of all backgrounds. In this image the transformer Raven protects himself and returns the cannibalistic energy of greed and consumption back onto its purveyor. \r\n\r\nThe second scene down depicts Escape. The captive child spirit has found his way out of the basket of the giantess known as the Atsi. Stories of this giant reach up and down the coast, and she goes by many names. My grandfather, Johnny Hanuse, called her “Skwanee.” She is known to steal unsuspecting children as they wander too far from the village. Often in the stories told about her, it is the most overlooked child who devises the plan to elude her. This piece was made to honour all of the Residential School child escapees. Over the years I have heard heroic stories of successful and attempted escapes from these schools, and many more fled within their imaginations. The children wanted to go home.\r\n\r\nThe third scene down contains the story of Rejection. P'kvs also known as the Wildman of the Woods is a forest ghost who tries to charm the living into crossing over into the ghost world. He offers gifts, but they are not what they seem. I feel his spirit parallels many figures and entities we deal with in our world today. Many of us choose to cope with reality by accepting illusions, resulting in suffering and living as a ghost. This piece is a reminder to not fall into the false worlds or take in bad medicine.\r\n\r\nThe final scene at the bottom is the Sisiutl, or double-headed sea serpent also known as Winalagalis. What I learn from this monster is the gift of choice and the need for Balance. The choice to build or destroy, and the choice to love or to hate. This serpent was still feared by many and consumed those who were weak in moral strength, but the greater message of the Sisiutl is that it is a choice to be weak or strong in spirit and mind.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have briefly described the scenes taking place, I also invite the viewer to construct their own narrative. When creating these designs I was conscious that children would be seeing them at bus stops. I wanted to create something that their imaginations could slip into. It is this ability to be free, to wonder, and to dream that was forcibly taken away by the Church and State-run Residential Schools, and it still a battle to hang on to our culture, languages and spiritual practice. I look to our stories for lessons on how to overcome the giants in our path.",

                "artistprojectstatement": "My project for Platforms 2015-17: Coastal City further develops two of my areas of interest: the shifting relationship between the digital and the physical, and the material, political, and ecological tension between the natural world and human-centered activities. Situated in a sensitive geographic location, Vancouver maintains environmental responsibilities that have both local and widespread implications. The material traces of these consequences—from remnants of foliage and forests to dried streams of water—are evoked in the work, through both production methods to the imagery and aesthetic. \r\nThe project is an extension of my recent series of unique gelatin silver prints, titled Autograms. The work consists of reproductions of three Autograms resulting in three distinct posters. The project includes images varying in dominant tone (for instance, one that is largely white, one grey, and one black). Creating an overall mood for each poster, this dominant tone can be seen to represent time of day, weather condition, or season. \r\nThese references to time and the natural world are echoed in both the material processes and compositions of the works. The biomorphic abstractions and “textures” are generated by contact printing acrylic paint on translucent plastic film, or utilizing materials that would typically be considered waste (polypropylene drop sheets, shipping packaging, etc.). This uneasy union between synthetic materials produces curiously natural results—the fractal forms are reminiscent of everything from rock formations to cedar bark. In this way, I see the works as a form of temporal excavation, resuscitating the organic ancestries of these petroleum products, even alluding to the networks of transportation and commerce required to procure the materials. These allusions to the distant past, and the pre-historic life forms that died to fuel the future, are complicated by references to more recent imaging technology, such as Photoshopped drop-shadows. \r\nAs these works are made using a contact printing process, the prints are highly detailed and especially compatible with digital enlargement—their magnification revealing fractal forms not visible to the naked eye. Expanded to the size of transit shelter posters, the biomorphic ‘figures’ that populate my works approach human-scale, creating a unique form of engagement and experience. Particularly well suited to viewers in transit, the high contrast figure-ground compositions function as both graphically prominent from a distance, and visually complex on close viewing. This high fidelity fractal detail suggests the imagery of coastal scenery, while the ‘figures’, oscillating between plant-like and humanoid, point to the changing landscape as a consequence of human-centered activities. In this way, the works speak to Vancouver as both a coastal city and an important ecosystem, and allude to our responsibilities as we move within it.",

What layers are we missing directly in front of us. / And after this, what piles of things, our appliances for living, what is needed then discarded into the dump, our archive of things. / What residue remains, detritus/artifacts/culture, what have we covered up, destroyed, demolished or buried. /We make piles of our past and then cart them away, out of sight. / The pastoral is present, somewhere in our minds eye, bracketed by the realities of our moment, the circumstances of our place. / Celestial views etched into a red car hood seen at night. In the suburban/urban setting, in a neighbourhood of homes on top of Coast Salish (Musqueam/ Squamish/Tsleil-Waututh) land at or near sən’a?qw/Sen’ákw (Kitsalano reduced from August Jack Xats'alanexw/Khahtsahlano). The ability of the abstract to bring one further into the scene, the setting, the night sky. / Canada’s institutional cultural genocide, the repression, the oppression of the physical space on indigenous children and indigenous life, the residential school buildings’ constructed architecture of trauma. / Survivors’ forms, the art that carries, CW’s carving area, creations out of the substance of life. / Nature’s forms, the beaver’s work/mark, the inspiration, the analogy used, crossing histories. / The inversely sanctified aquarium tank, attempting to preserve and replicate the ‘natural’ setting in a fluorescent lit steel box. Nature does persist, we are part of it, strangely. / The humans’ markings, what tools we need, remnants/reminiscent of our settler history. / A found pile of dead Yellow Jacket wasps tenacious, their ‘industrialness’ rivals the bees’ and is even more viscous in its defence, the nearness of life and death, the corpse in our presence and attraction/fear of the dangers of what may be found. / We come from water, from once was us and them as one there, now etched into rocks where water once was. / Artifice representing other pasts, the internment of others, the waste, the defilement, the failure of ‘knowledge’. / How do we position ourselves in relation to the natural, what is our place.. The dolphins swim by, in a pod, weaving as one, the young human hand reaches out, trying to grasp what she is missing or to bond and show affection for something that is so close to us at times and at other times so distant. / Coastal nature’s beauty and wonder. As if we could ever imitate these colours and forms. Real life playing out, evolution on display. / Our de-evolution, global consumerism, consuming the world, all enveloped in its path, here and elsewheres. Coastal cities linked by commerce, succumbing to history. / And the gaze, wonderment, looking, into and beyond where we are in present histories, connecting us. / The construction of the coastal city, metaphorically and literally, the building over of histories and the continuation of colonial/historical trajectories. The imposition of technology/machinery over the ‘natural’/nature and the juxapositions that illustrate this. The water connecting us all.My intent with this work is to present images that are incidentally seen or viewed in purpose, passed by and through on a daily basis, drawing-in, and tracing relationships, enabling viewers to engage in reflection and consideration of the layers of the present and of histories that we are emersed in, swimming in, in this place called home.

The five works in this series take the form of quasi-inspirational posters created from altered self-help and new-age book covers. Both the myth and experience of Vancouver as a ‘Coastal City’ connect with overarching ideas in Mallett’s practice; this new series of images is akin to her ongoing series Personhood, which pulls its imagery from covers of self-improvement texts popular in the ‘70s and ‘80s exploring the terrain of quasi-mysticism, personal empowerment, and commodity culture. Taking a form reminiscent of outdated posters, these works isolate elliptical statements on self-improvement and the nature of being in self-referential and critical ways. The Journey references what the artist describes as a ‘West Coast New-Age’ culture, with a specific focus on ideas of travel, movement, and transition. These works play with themes of ‘transit’ and the ‘Coastal City’ in direct response to the situation of the work in the transit shelter ad spaces around Vancouver, through alluding to this regionally specific ‘new-age’ sensibility as well as the commonly used metaphor of ‘the journey’ in self-help literature.The artist would like to thank Nigel Lew and Emiliano Sepulveda for their assistance in making this work.",

These are two separate crests carved in combination.\r\n\r\nBear's feet rest on the head of the supernatural Mountain Hawk.  \"He's always shown with both a recurved beak and a mouth with many teeth.  It is a crest of my family,\" the carver said.\r\n\r\nAlso belonging to the Muldoe family is a very old crest known as Halfway Out, seen at the base of the pole.  The origin of this goes back to the war expedition of the warrior Naeqt against the Kitimat people of the coast.  In the early 1920s, his great-grandson gave an account of the gruesome event to Canadian anthropologist Marius Barbeau: \"Naeqt started on the warpath against Kitimat.  On his way down, he came upon a camp, wherein a man sat by himself.  He took his knife and cut the man through the middle almost in two halves, so strong was he.  The wounded man ran into the lake and stood in the water up to his ribs.\"  The name and the crest Halfway Out were derived from this incident and brought back by the warrior.",

In other words to be both part of yet separate from the surrounding architectural reality.\r\n\r\nThe references are many yet suggest nothing to anchor the sculpture into a specific interpretation. The black and white bands of stone may recall 12th century Italian church architecture. The gold leafed spheres with the projecting necks are suggestive of the retorts of the medieval alchemists whose putative ambition was to transmute lead into gold. The gold forms also suggest the popular symbols of the male and female. In addition the tower or column elevates the gold objects and, by making them inaccessible, enhances their mystery. \r\n\r\nResting lightly on the column in spite of their considerable mass, the scale and precarious position of the spheres imply the possibility of arrival from some unknown place and time to briefly alight before moving on - a suggestion of a mind or consciousness, of the anthropomorphic? Or the kinetic potential of a bird that briefly alights on a rooftop before flying on.\r\n\r\nThe placing of real gold - which one usually finds in the sanctity of the church, in museums, or bank vaults - into the public realm is a means of acknowledging that there can be riches for public pleasure, treasure above ground for the eye to see and the spirit to ponder; a recognition that public art is, in every sense, an honouring of and a gifting to the community.",

The work is based on the postcard idea from my previous project, Your Private Sky-- postcards that could be used as hand-held frames-- but more specific to the Vancouver vista. The piece consists of 3 custom-made postcards, a roaming kiosk-sculpture that inhabited various sites during the Olympics, and a website where people could post images of the landscapes they had created. Loosely the work invites people to imagine the landscape as their own, as a changing, subjective experience that counteracts the enormity of a mass marketed event like the Olympics. The work was on view at 2 different sites during the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Vancouver.",

The kiosk was both sculptural and practical and acted as a place from which to engage with people and the landscape in an otherwise frenetic environment. Visitors will have a chance to share their custom postcards by posting them to the Flickr group Vancouver Vancouver Vancouver and vancouvervancouvervancouver.com until the end of 2010.\r\n“The postcards are designed as do-it-yourself framing devices, and through them, one might view infinite vistas and recombinant\r\nversions of Vancouver, both here and elsewhere.

Together the team dug deep into the history of the area to produce a mural that is a reflection of the community, past and present: The smell of the smoke of ancient fires wafts up from the cedar baskets behind glass in the Museum of Anthropology, still. For artists Joey Mallett and Rita Buchwitz, who were studying Coast Salish basket patterns, the smoke was an integral part of the St. James mural because \"it is such a tangible connection to the past…\" A Salish design stamped on a totem pole, a branch of cedar, and an eagle circling above the area once known as Japantown, honor the history of the area. Pink cherry blossoms reach into the view above several old buildings still standing today - once a grocery, a rooming house - across the street from the Oppenheimer Park then a thriving Japanese fishing fleet that was confiscated during WW2, when the Japanese were sent to internment camps. The boats glow like a ghostly city at sunset. A school of herring swim in a wave of abundance - the herring roe industry was big then. Shells of shucked off clam shells formed a midden off what is now Crab Park. And the seagulls? They are as they were. The St. James Mural was funded by a grant from the City of Vancouver for Vancouver's 125th Anniversary.",

Artists reclaimed privatized space by interrupting the steady flow of commercial advertising through placement of media art works.  The artists used a wide range of innovative approaches that explored using the video medium in 10 seconds. This included the cinematic, graphic, poetic, animated, performative, dramatic and the mining of archives.  This experimental project claimed and recontextualized privatized space for the creation and presentation of new forms of public art for mass audience consumption. The placement of the works was both subliminal and subversive.  \r\n\r\n10 Second launched April 2011 with archival film footage of the first Stanley Park Easter Be-In depicting a hippie chick dancing freely.\r\n\r\nThemes included intergenerational and cross-generational arcs in addressing the shared trajectories of family and community histories, and in the process uncovered and preserved history as contemporary media.  A grandfather’s legacy is remixed into a multi-screen montage; in a touching portrait two Chinese grannies walk on water taking us through the ages; a performance artist soars over the city suspended from a helicopter; a new immigrant uses technology as a measure to contrast shifting cultures; Twitter becomes op art, and QR codes function as art that takes us into portals. Events such as the Stanley Cup Riot, inspired the animation of fire-breathing serpents. This work can be seen as a reflection on the recent past and of things yet to come in the year of the water-dragon.",

Ezawa’s rendering is faithful to the original source image by maintaining the photograph’s basic structure and framing. By eliminating details, the image refers less to a specific group of individuals, and more to a general sign of a collective body united in a common purpose. In light of recent events in which demands for societal reform have become apparent both in Canada and abroad, Ezawa’s portrait of democracy could not be more timely.\" - Vancouver Art Gallery Website",

                "artistprojectstatement": "\"When I was first asked to submit a concept for a public art piece to be installed at the Canada Line Station entrance at the intersection of Georgia and Granville Street, I visited the site. Of course I knew beforehand what the function of the entrance was, with its stairs and escalators. But knowing about the function of something versus experiencing it firsthand are different. The first leads to an objective, factual kind of understanding, while the latter leads one to a more poetic understanding in which analogous connections can come to mind. Seeing the toing and froing of commuters going up and down the stairs and escalators brough to my mind remembered experiences of salmon migrating up the Campbell River and its tributaries and the eventual return of new, young salmon downstream to the ocean. Seeing that event left me unexpectedly, strongly affected. I wanted to see if I might be able to bring some aspect of it into my work. So I began making a series of photographs at the Capilano Hatchery in North Vancouver. When the City of Vancouver Public Art Department approached me regarding the creation of a public artwork, I was in the early stages of collecting images of Salmon. But I had not yet reached a decision on how I would eventually employ these images. The Canada Line project brought this into focus for me. \r\n\r\nI wanted whatever image I created for the Canada Line Station entrance to have a strong connection to the function of the site as well as to life on the Coast of British Columbia. I wanted viewers to be able to recognize and appreciate these connections. Further to this, I hoped to trigger people’s thoughts about these wild creatures and how they have exerted such a powerful effect on the rhythm of life along our coast throughout living memory as well as long before that. They have always been central in our cultures and economies. \r\n\r\nI chose to represent the salmon swimming within a structure that recreates the look of a fish ladder rather than attempting to show them swimming in the wild. I believe this allows viewers to connect my image to the structure and function of the Canada Line entrance, hopefully in a whimsical way. However, the image structure is also meant to allude to our processes for studying the life cycle of salmon, controlling and promoting the continued, healthy reproduction of their various wild species, and ensuring continued future harvests.\r\n\r\nThese fish are full of vitality and a sense of undeterred purpose in the face of all obstacles. They are powerful swimmers that remain wild and mysterious, even when they find themselves channeled through our systems. I have tried to express some of these qualities by catching their images in moments when they are highly animated, swimming through turbulent water filled with swirling bubbles, their bodies dark and unknowable in their watery element.\" - Jim Breukelman, 2013",

The salmon are shown as dark and mysterious…wild. The fish images are printed on sold Vinyl, while the borders are printed 50% grey on perforated Vinyl to provide commuters with unobstructed views to the outside of the station equal to 50% of the glass windows. (This was a safety requirement). When viewed from station's interior, the borders are clear. Viewed from outside, they are a semi-opaque grey. From the outside, viewers can see some movement of people travelling through the space to the stairs and escalators. Also, the feeling of the mural changes as the light conditions evolve with weather conditions and time of day, which tends to animate the piece, complimenting the captured movement of the fish and water. The mural panels are designed to utilize the structure of the glass panels and their support hardware as integral elements of the overall image structure. The City Centre Station mural is commissioned two times a year by the Public Art Program in partnership with InTransit BC's Canada Line Public Art Program.",

This space is both literally and figuratively fluid, and it is from this source that our project draws inspiration. This series of posters takes water as its subject matter. These posters are a collaboration between Seattle-based artists Coley Mixan and Krista Schoening, with Schoening’s careful, meditative drawings as a foundation, and Mixan’s expansive digital re-working of those grey-scale drawings into vibrant color as a final step. The result is a composition of wave patterns, hand-drawn, then scanned, digitally collaged, and transformed. Our hope is that the result is peaceful – an ideal state of mind to cultivate at a bus stop – yet dynamic.The energy of the color and the wave pattern is a visual reference to the spirit of the port city, as a cosmopolitan destination for people and ideas. In addition to salt water waves lapping their shores, port cities are often the first places to receive waves of immigrants, new thoughts, and new technologies. The bright, rainbow-inspired palette of our proposed posters, references the welcoming and tolerant spirit of the people of Vancouver. We hope that, like a Zen garden, the calming effect of wave patterns will benefit commuters waiting for a bus, inviting them to enjoy a quiet moment of contemplation.",

Pulling from personal experience moving throughout North America as a first-generation immigrant, the work connects notions of home and heritage to the undocumented labour and disposession experienced by people of color, individuals and families alike. In an era of gatekeeping national borders; rising violence directed towards  immigrants and refugees; and persisting conditions of systemic racial violence, the series juxtaposes national landmarks and marked lands with protest to confront the tenuous conditions of cultural assimilation and belonging, as well as propose measures of resistance and resilience.  \r\n\r\nInformed by a lifetime of movement through the United States, Canada, and South Korea, Josephine Lee&rsquo;s interdisciplinary practice is heavily informed by the psychic violence of cultural assimilation and naturalization through migration. Lee&rsquo;s sculptures, installations, and performances, intersect  narratives of dispossession and nationalism, making explicit how ideas of place are entangled within politics of citizenship and national identity. Within this framework, Lee&rsquo;s materials and forms  both signify and complicate overlapping identity formations, and notions of home and belonging. Lee&rsquo;s current research examines how technological transformations connect directly to systems of  political power, environmental degradation, and racial inequality. Further, she explores how these technologies may be configured toward BIPOC futures to enact cultural resilience and propose new orientations within bodies, ecologies, and architectural spaces.",

For the artists, this process was reminiscent of picking and cleaning berries, something they both grew up doing. The glass, after being cleaned and sorted, has an alluring appearance. It sparkles in the light, and becomes less recognizable - less easily associated with automobiles - allowing for new connections. These digital studies read at many scales, connecting to imagery of the cosmos, or to views of cellular structures.",

We see this aspect of our project as a ghost-like trace of an ephemeral, unplanned path - memorializing something that is so much a part of everyday life that it almost escapes notice…\"  \"We have marked out this path with ten clear resin capsules with objects cast into them.  The objects are things you would normally carry in your pockets: notes, bus tickets, loose change, etc.\" Re door and window frames: Our intention is to raise questions around ideas of ownership of and entitlement to the city: whose city?  Do we feel the city belongs to us because it is 'public'?  Or do we think of entitlement in terms of private property: what we own or don't own?\" Regarding the weathervanes: \"The turning of the signs in the wind functions as metaphor for shifting notions of community, place, and a sense of entitlement we feel as citizens.\"    \"The title \"Right to the City\" comes from the urban theorist Henri Lefebvre's text by the same name which calls for a different envisioning of the city: for it to be organized for, and belong to, its inhabitants, rather than organized for profit.  The elements in this project explore the contradictions and ambiguities of public and private space.  Although we can identify in general with Vancouver as 'our city', as belonging to the public, space in the city is clearly delineated: either it belong to you or id doesn't.  The space along Nanaimo is technically public space, and unlike the neighbouring yards, anyone can go on this space.  However, in the larger scheme of things, do we feel entitled to it as a space?  We're interested in drawing attention to the public nature of this space and the claims made on the city.  Related to these ideas, this artwork addresses the ephemeral, shifting nature of the site, both in terms of the physical environment and cultural priorities.  This area was once a vacant lot and is now a small park.  We hope the work will open up a space for contemplation and reconsideration on the meaning of these transitions.  This is a chance to look at the neighbourhood in another way, and by extension, the city.\"  (from the Artists' Statement, 2004)",

                "artistprojectstatement": "As part of Instant Coffee's self-proclaimed “Year of Bright Days,” the exhibit, A Bright Future was a four part public commission for \"88 BLOCKS Art on Main\". Instant Coffee has a reclaimed aesthetic and a social intention that played out over the four components: Blanket Bus; Instant Coffee 500; Say Nothing in Bright Colours; and Instant Coffee Light Bar Bus Shelter. All the components functioned as short moments of reprieve as visual fields that are most typically reserved for advertising. Even though Instant Coffee often formally plays with the style of advertising it does so without a clear focused point of sale.\r\n\r\nFor Blanket Bus, Instant Coffee re-positioned and re-scaled the typical hand crafted afghan blanket, wrapping five sides of an articulated bus with large realistic photo images of the blankets. With its erratic and saturated palette and its repetitive grid line and block form, this vernacular aesthetic of the afghan was synthetically ripe, easily appropriated from its modest domestic crafting place and resituated at a larger scale into a public space, one of advertising. Since the artist collective's inception in 2000, Instant Coffee has used language as part of their practice, designing slogans like \"it doesn't have to be good to be meaningful and \"get social or get lost.\" It is through succinct catchphrases, which at times drip with the sincerity of self-help jargon, ring with the urgings of advertising slogans or resound with a dissonant irony, that Instant Coffee applies to Say Nothing in Bright Colours, a series of seven individually hand painted sandwich boards that will be permanently installed in various locations along Main St in Vancouver. \r\n\r\nInstant Coffee often invites other artists to participate in their projects and they continued this tradition for Instant Coffee 500, where they asked 14 artists to design 16 interior car ad cards to be displayed in one bus. Instant Coffee then asked bus patrons to vote on which artist ad card they like best. For two weeks, transit riders voted on their favorite design via text messaging and online.  The winning artist received a $500.00 prize and their design was featured on the outside of another number three Main Street bus for the remainder of the project. For the Light Bar Bus Shelter, Instant Coffee adapted the Main and West 20th bus shelter into a full spectrum light therapy bar. In a place, such as Vancouver, Canada, with much darkness and rain, the negative effects from this lack of sunlight has on individual psyches and the larger social milieu seems at times seems paramount. Instant Coffee offered a moment of solace; only fifteen minutes at the bus shelter was needed for a daily dose of vitamin D and a brighter future.",

They appear and reappear in personal photographs, are reproduced into small plastic objects sold in tourist gift-shops, and are pictured in mass-produced postcards. These items become souvenirs, tokens of remembrance – in this case of an experience of a place -- that are meant to be severed from the original location and moment of experience, in order to be collected, shared, or circulated.\r\nGirl In The City follows the character Girl as she encounters some noted Vancouver landmarks. In the animations, Girl interacts with these structures, approaches them, then picks them up, revealing them to be toys or miniatures. She then takes them away with her, to add them to her collection of objects. The animations are 30 seconds each, the approximate length of a single television ad, and are meant to be played interspersed between regular programming on a screen.",

As artists, we are interested in the kinds of specific attention that happens when music is lifted out of these economies.\r\n \r\nThe songs are simple melodies in the key of C. The basic musical training required to sight read the songs belongs to anyone who has gone through the high school band program, junior piano classes or been an avid reader of Guitar World magazine. The songs should be accessible to a large, if not very often addressed, audience. In a way these songs harken back to an earlier mode of music distribution, that of 19th century parlour music, sheet music meant to be sung at home with a piano.\"",

All of these activities are at the heart of Vancouver's history - a town founded on the site of a sawmill. The artist's careful selection and processing of these source images brings this history back into the present. Inserted into the flow of fast-paced modern advertising on the CoreVision Screens, the images seem grainy and dream-like, as if a memory of the land has returned to haunt the present.",

The desire was to have an integrated light art work on the concrete cores of the two towers that would set apart the building and at the same time relate to its surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe idea for the light installation was inspired by the natural surroundings.The city skyline holds a spectacular backdrop of mountains and water. But the work also responds to the architecture of the building which is constructed of glass all the way around apart from the concrete core. The two towers are connected by a lower section between them. The building is not rectangular but instead protrudes at different angles drawing diagonal lines in the glass facade. These angles can be seen as mountain peaks and they became the starting point for the light design. Led light lines were mounted on the concrete core horizontally. The lines reveal 40 different preset modes which have been uploaded to the rgb modules. One state is a graphic pattern of a single angle that meets up with angle of the building representing the sihouette of a mountain. This image remains the same but the colors change very gradually. The flow of the colors was inspired by the changes of the seasons and the changes of the day. They blend into each other with fades making the transitions look natural as part of the environment. The graphic state is sometimes intercepted by a dynamic state where a motion is simulated of water running down the building. The whole sequence takes more than 8 hours so it is not to be seen as a light show but more as a general presence.",

                "artistprojectstatement": "\"Southwest and Southeast Marine drive has always loomed in my mind as Vancouver’s spookiest strip. Since childhood, every time I’ve driven down it, I’ve been creeped out by the scary 1930s and 1940s industrial structures to the south — by the endless repetitive loop of fast food and dead underwatered lawns, and by its overabundance of appallingly cheap commercial architecture. In my mind, when children die, their ghosts went to work inside those scary brick buildings. Inside the fast food joints, the fare was probably saltier and greasier than anywhere else, and if you went into one of the businesses or professional buildings, cults would hand you religious pamphlets, and when you left, your clothing would smell like your grandmother’s front hall cupboard and a moldy copy of Life magazine with Pat Nixon on the cover.\r\n\r\nI’ve been watching the strip’s ongoing redevelopment over the past decade, and while I’m glad it’s finally changing, I’ve been slightly unsure of what it’s changing into. The stores are now big and clean and shiny and no longer coma inducing — but maybe every time you buy something there, a penguin dies in Antarctica or a tree is chopped down up north, never to be replanted? Well, that’s just me being morbid. It’s now actually much better than it was before — the air of unipolar depression is gone — replaced by the early 21st century’s version of perfected retail, that of inventory-optimized big box shopping. The city has also kept what little good architecture there was and is making a definite attempt to green the place up. So when it came time to think of something for this location, I thought, ‘Why not revel in the consumer fantasia that is the Big Box?’  To do something earnest or minimal in the way that we expect public art to be seemed like a defeatist strategy. Anything sparse or overly cerebral would be optically clubbed to death by a staggering amount of colorful signage, and a chance to say something exciting or uplifting about the place would be lost in a possible miasma of jargon and Corten steel slabs.\r\n\r\nCanadian Tire is a store about possibilities; we all know the wonderful sense of creative omnipotence we feel walking down the aisles: Oh, the things I could do with those slats! And why, are those thin-veneer doors useful as tabletops? And look! An eight-can paint-shaker! We know the smell of fertilizer, plywood and galvanized nails. And we most of all know the smell of rubber tires — the smell of long-chain carbon molecules off-gassing in a way that no ventilation system can ever fight. And in Canadian Tire, the rubber you smell is possibly a Motomaster whitewall, and that’s what Infinite Tire is: a Brancusi-esque expression of joy in all things suburban, a wink to the notion of better living through abundance, and a totem of sorts that acknowledges and revels in the choices and creative freedom that can be inherent in industrial sizing systems.\" - Douglas Coupland, 2012",

The artwork incorporates the artists signature style of Pop-Culture-meets-Aboriginal Art to make this history visible in our daily lives. \r\n\r\nThe marker is installed on both sides of Kingsway and mimics highway signs that identify the route, including a stylized maple leaf using coastal First Nations design elements. The project informs people of the ancient foot trail that connected the Fraser River and what later became New Westminster and False Creek and English Bay. The signs also acknowledge the early colonial history as a wagon road.",

The twelve-pound cannon in Stanley Park is now fired nightly to mark the time. Previously it was fired to signal the close of the fishing day and as a navigational aid. For this project, each daily cannon blast is symbolically dedicated to a cultural, social, or political figure or event in Vancouver or BC's history relevant to that date. The project acoustically memorializes the culture and politics that ground this history, towards imagining Vancouver as a socially and spatially just city. For one year, beginning May 2011, \"A Sign for the City\" circulated the 365 dates through monthly memorial calendars in the form of transit shelter ads, full-page ads in The Georgia Straight, and an edition of calendar notebooks, which could be picked up at the Audain Gallery SFU Woodward's; Or Gallery; READ Books, Chareles H.

The images were created in the style of the exquisite corpse, a technique made popular by the surrealists in the early 20th century as a way of exploring the unconscious and associative powers of images. The three artists worked from different geographic areas, on-reserve and off, in urban and rural contexts, and these differences inform the imagery and speak to the complexity of Aboriginal identities. The images explore reconciliation through relationships to land, territory, nationhood and concepts of spirituality, faith and \"wholeness.\"",

                "artistprojectstatement": "“Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world” is the title of a text-and-image based work meant for installation at transit shelters. There is a certain fictional quality to the term “coastal city”, metaphorically on the verge of the imaginary, the otherworldly, the historic and the futuristic. “From a distance, the work mines the history of travel books from the early 19th century Baedekers to more recent and popular guides such as Lonely Planet and Frommers. While these guidebooks are meant as references for the worldly globetrotter, they nonetheless fulfill the desires of armchair vacationers and urban travellers alike. Upon closer inspection, one notes that the poster is a composite of two images. The smaller of the two images is an excerpt from a larger print, an ocean wave pattern from a woodblock print by Japanese ukiyo-e master Toyohara Kunichika (1835-1900) from a series of prints depicting shipwrecks. “Ukiyo” is a Japanese term meaning “the floating world”, a reference to the pleasure-seeking urban lifestyles of Edo-period Japan (1600-1867). The larger image is a photograph of Vancouver’s False Creek shoreline with objects introduced into the image. One might ask: what is an ikat fabric, a piece of imari-inspired china and a silvered cruciform-topped cruet stopper doing on the shoreline? And what could it all mean?\r\nVancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world” is a work that references contemporary and historic nomadic life. Recent events involving travel, global weather patterns and natural occurrences in the Far East and our own West Coast shores have shown evidence of unexpected material and climactic exchange resulting in an archaeological array of accidental artefacts washing up on all shorelines along the Pacific. After all, cultural exchange is not limited to capitalistic trade. These artefacts are accidental travellers, nomadic ephemera that unwittingly influence our cultural landscape and a testimony to the independent life of objects. As the primordial ocean is the birthplace of life, the coastline is the threshold of humanity, our culture and our civilization. As the knowledge of our culture expands through the exchange of ideas, the history of trade can partly be told through the history of our coastline. From anecdotes predating the Galleon Trade1 to our present-day container cargo ships, our waterways and oceans tell the story of cultural exchange, some through trade while others through natural happenstance. “Vancouver Coastal: a nomad’s guide to the floating world” is both laden with truth and a work of fiction made possible through subjective and speculative storytelling. It epitomises how our coastline embodies our cultural makeup and experiences, and is a catalyst in triggering memories and starting conversations. Regardless of whether these stories are truth, fiction or somewhere in between, they nonetheless allow us to share our experiences without judgement.",

                "artistprojectstatement": "\"I remember growing up and seeing photos of redwood stumps in northern California, photos in which, “Wow! You can drive a car right through it!” I remember always thinking of what an affront to nature it was to use a car as a standard of bigness, but that was the early twentieth century. Later in the century, in 1995, I was in Ireland and phoning home for voicemail messages and had one from my mother that said, “Hi Dear, Constable So-and-so from the Vancouver Police phoned to ask if you’d deliberately left your VW parked inside the Hollow Tree in Stanley Park before you left and, to be honest, with you we never know, so could you give him a ring?” My car had been stolen from an underground parkade and abandoned in the tree by joyriders.\r\n \r\n    In 2006 Stanley Park’s Hollow Tree, an 800-year-old Western red cedar stump, was damaged in a particularly bad storm, and the City of Vancouver made a stab at removing it. I don’t know what they were thinking. Everyone in the city went crazy. The Hollow Tree is where people had their grad photos taken. It’s where they had their first kiss; it’s where everybody takes their relatives from overseas. In 2009 the Hollow Tree Conservation Society, funded entirely by private donations, stabilized the tree, and in October 2011 it was restored as well as possible, and made open to the public. I was pretty supportive of this project but years later I’m looking at the tree and I can see its days are numbered. It’s a piece of dead wood hundreds of years old. It’s rotting. It’s nature. So I wondered, “Why not transform the tree? Why not put it through a mirror and have it come out the other side as a mythical entity?” This is what I did with the Golden Tree at the corner of SW Marine Drive and Cambie Street. It’s a mirror of something that once was — and will still be for a little while — and it establishes the existence of an evolving city that has an evolving sense of nature and ecosystems. It’s also located at the Canada Line Station, and I realize for many people coming to Vancouver, they’ll see the Golden Tree before they see the Hollow Tree, as if reading the chapters in a book in the wrong order, and isn’t that life?\"",

Incorporating drawn images of birds of different species gathered together into one flock as notional surrogates for the varied population of peoples that make up the city, this assemblage of birds will be made up of a diverse polyglot group. Not unlike the \"impossible bouquet\" - a concept that emerged in Dutch still life painting in the 17th century, which was an artificial fantasy of flowers that could never bloom naturally in the same season and geographic region - the birds depicted at once mirror the cultural identities of the inhabitants of this city of Vancouver from different parts of the world while speaking to the democratic nature of the public transit system which brings together people from all walks of life. Produced by the Contemporary Art Gallery in partnership with the City of Vancouver Public Art Program.",

The rope marks where the canoes were pulled up can still be seen on Mount Garibaldi and Mount Baker.This Coast Salish version shows a Thunderbird warning the people that the waters are rising. The Thunderbird resides in the sun. He is the Creator’s messenger. He helps the people on earth by warning them of oncoming events, usually of storms, but now he speaks of climate change. He is telling the people that the waters will keep rising until the people take full stewardship of precious Mother Earth. The Tyee Salmon are the knowledge keepers, and the Eulochon fish represent the learners. I have chosen this theme due to Indigenous concerns about stewardship of the land and waters, and the climate change crisis that is upon us.",

I also felt a sense of nobility, respect, and inspiration when a chief's regalia covered a part of my body. I also used images of salmon leather, Coast Salish formlines, berries, patterns and textures. My interest to use self-portraits has become a study of traditional art and regalia to be manifested in my work; with the intent to discover more about my Coast Salish, Cree and Shuswap art practices.\"",

Riffing on these conventions, Tergesen&rsquo;s work displays mutated objects that are no longer whole, but have been transformed into new hybrid creations. The photographs ask questions of the viewer: what differentiates a chore such as meal preparation from an act of play? How can the home be used or seen in new ways?",

Working loosely from satellite images of empty parking lots within the city of Vancouver and improvisational marks made during the printing process, these Vacant Lots portray both a timeline of activity and a pause. The prints recall feelings of isolation, confinement, and emptiness, similar to when the world seemed to pause in March of 2020. On the surface they are uninhabited but when viewed from above, they embody an organized togetherness and signal a presence within a field of absence.",
